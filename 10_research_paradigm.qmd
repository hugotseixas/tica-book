# Conceitos Fundamentais {#sec-paradigm}

The research paradigm of this work is made explicit to inform the ontological and epistemological foundations of the project, and to justify the adopted methodologies, that will serve to answer the research questions. The research philosophy follows the Critical Realism, which defines the ontology and epistemology. The research methodology is a mixed method approach, applying a combination of grounded theory, field theory of Bourdieu, and statistical regression algorithms.

In this chapter I explain the Critical Realism as the research philosophy, and justify the alignment of the methodology with the philosophical ontology and epistemology.

## Critical Realism {#sec-cr}

Critical realism is a philosophy of science that may serve as a framework for developing research methodologies [@fletcher-2016]. It is a perspective that negates the duality between the social and the natural, as also negates the determination of the social by the natural [@gorski-2013], and neither the other way around [@fletcher-2016]. Instead, its focus is on the inference of causal mechanisms [@lawani-2020], which dictates the natural and the social altogether. In this section, I define the ontology and epistemology, based on the paradigm of critical realism, adopted in this work, and how they justify the methodology.

-   Ontology: There are three ontological domains, in other words, reality is stratified: the domain of the real, formed by the generative mechanisms that act as causal forces to produce events [@fletcher-2016]; the domain of the actual, that contains the realization of the real domain, when the generative mechanisms are activated and occurs whether or not these realizations can be perceived or measured; the domain of the empirical where the actual domain is observed, in other words, is where the events caused by the activation of generative mechanisms of the real domain are perceived or measured;

-   Epistemology: Knowldge is obtained by interpreting patterns and tendencies of perceived and measured events, with the objective of explaining the phenomena of interest by the generative mechanisms that dictates it [@lawani-2020; @wynn-2012].

## Sociological Field Theory {#sec-bourdieu}

The field theory is a method of analysis that describes social arenas where actors pursue an objective at stake, interacting with other actors to achieve their goals [@kluttz-2016]. Bourdieu is a recognized sociologist that influenced the Sociological Field Theory, having developed the concepts of field, habitus, capital and doxa. His theory is widely applied in diverse areas of study due to its generalized nature.

The concept of field in the perspective of Bourdieu is that fields are arenas of disputes between different social actors [@kluttz-2016]. The social actors occupy a certain position in the field, and are in dispute towards an objective at stake [@thomson-2014]. Each field functions according to it's own logic, or in other words, present specific "rules of the game" [@kluttz-2016; @thomson-2014].

The capital is the manifestation of different types of power, that can be economic, cultural or social [@kluttz-2016].

The habitus is a property of social actors, that along with the capital and the field, shapes the practices of these social actors [@maton-2014]. It describes a dynamic process of action performed in the field, formed by subjective constructions and objective dispositions, in a sense that the habitus of these social actors is affected by and also affects the social structures of a field [@kluttz-2016].

The doxa can be considered as implicit rules operating within a field. It the result of conquests of social actors that set rules, laws, discursive forms, normative beliefs, expected actions and behaviors and barriers to entry in a specific field [@deer-2014].

## Statistical Modeling {#sec-stats}

Statistical modeling can be useful for explaining and predicting an observable phenomena. When creating a statistical model, we accept (implicitly or explicitly) a diverse number of assumptions that should be true for the model to represent reality correctly. However, the correctness of all the assumptions is impossible, so we are limited to make estimations about the phenomena of interest. Following this reasoning, we should not condition the reality to the statistical models that we create, in reality, it should be the other way around, theories about reality should condition our statistical models.

The use of statistical causal inference methods is a possible way to develop a statistical model informed by causal theory, and is usually applied when the objective is to explain certain phenomena. Statistical algorithms can also be used solely for prediction, with the goal of minimizing prediction errors, but not taking to account causal mechanisms of the phenomena of interest. However, both approaches do not need to be completely separated, prediction exercises can also be informed by causal inference techniques, in order to create fair statistical models, which can be useful for exploration of a phenomena.

The statistical perspective is coherent with the ontological perspective of Critical Realism. Statistical inference aims to propose models of data generating process, which are the causal mechanisms that forms the real domain. In statistics we are only able to perform these inferences based on observable events triggered by the activation of certain causal mechanisms, and our estimations of that event is an imperfect representation of the actual domain. The "distance" between the empirical and the actual domains is defined as the error of a statistical model, and integrates estimates and model errors.
