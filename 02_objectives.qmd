# Objectives

The main objective of this project is to develop a framework to model deforestation and its impacts, using variables of different dimensions (environment and society) to predict quantitative estimations of deforestation and its social and environmental impacts. The main objective will be composed of related questions:

(1) What are the qualitative and quantitative variables that are associated with deforestation and its impacts?

(2) What are the possibilities and challenges to translate these variables in a common format to provide information to the models?

(3) What are the importance of the variables, and how do they interact between one another, according to the models?

(4) What inferences can be made about the model results and policies being applied to curb deforestation?
