# Interviews

The objective of the interviews is to explore a diverse range of possible causes of deforestation, and its impacts on the environment and society.

The target participants are researchers with past experience on analyzing deforestation in the Amazon or Cerrado biomes.

The prospection of potential participants will be done by snowball sampling.

The interviews will consist of open questions and an interactive activity of building a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) with the participants.

## Questions

The open questions will serve to develop a context of the participant experience and perspectives on deforestation.

 - What were your past experiences on deforestation?
 
 - What were the regions that you developed projects related to deforestation?
 
 - What is your perspective on deforestation, taking in account sustainability and human development?
 
 - Based on your experience, what are the main conditions that facilitate the occurrence of deforestation?
 
## Interactive activity

The objective of developing DAGs with different participants is to explore a diversity of possibilities to model deforestation. The use of DAGs before any modelling exercise (such as feature selection) is useful to reflect about the phenomena, explore potential variables, look for possible confounders, colliders and mediators, and finally choose an appropriate model.

It is also possible to compare DAGs (since they are graphs!), so it will open an opportunity to explore convergences and divergences between participants.

The DAGs will be create during the interview with the use of a interactive tool.
