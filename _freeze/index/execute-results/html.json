I have adapted this method to gather data from interviews and the literature, in order to trace the causes of deforestation.\n\nThe qualitative assessment of the resulting scientific model is based on Bordieu's work.\nThe concepts of social fields and habitus of different groups is a powerful tool to explore conflicts of interests related to deforestation in Brazil.\n\nFor the quantitative analysis, a subset of variables from the scientific model were selected by two criteria: (1) the variable can be represented in a structured numerical format; (2) the variable is assumed to have a causal effect on deforestation.\nThe second criterion relies on formal causal inference methods of variable selection, which is fundamental to create fair and robust statistical learning models.\nApart from using causality foundations to select variables, the quantitative analysis is based on a prediction modelling framework, composed by statistical learning algorithms.\n\nFinally, the results from qualitative and quantitative assessments are compared and discussed in light with the literature.\nInterpretation and discussion of results relies on a skeptical perspective of the models, which are a flawed representation of the phenomena of interest.\nHowever, they still provide a useful source of information to advance the knowledge about the deforestation in the Amazon and Cerrado.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Representation of the Cerrado biome.
