# Preface {.unnumbered}

This work is an effort to develop an interdisciplinary approach to analyse social and environmental dimensions related to deforestation[^index-1] in the Amazon and Cerrado biomes.
The main objective is to use qualitative and quantitative methods to explore causes of deforestation in these areas, and uncover underlying social conflicts that emerge and shape this phenomena.

The motivation to develop this research is to account for a diversity of factors involved in the deforestation process.
When analyzing social and environmental variables, we must always remember what lies hidden in numerical values, individuals, relationships, culture, landscapes.
Is it possible to avoid omitting these when conducting research at large scales?
How to represent them inside structured data formats?

The fact is that is usually not possible to abstract certain phenomena in a quantitative framework.
That's why interdisciplinary approaches, using qualitative and quantitative methods, can support deep and rich analysis about complex and dynamic processes, such as deforestation.

In this work, I try to perform such task by running parallel analysis of different dimensions, but based in common grounds.
Such as @fig-amazon-hex and @fig-cerrado-hex, this project is composed by numerical analysis of structured spatial data (represented as regular grid cells), as also by sociological investigation of social and environmental processes that can't be measured.

Before diving into this work, I would like to first introduce some key foundations adopted in my research.

As a philosophical background for the work, I have adopted the perspective of Critical Realism, which focuses on causal analysis in the social field.
This is the umbrella for the thesis, and the perspective I use both in planning the analysis and interpreting my results.

The information gathering to create my scientific model[^index-2] is based on Grounded Theory", which is a general method to gather data in qualitative studies and test theories. I have adapted this method to gather data from interviews and the literature, in order to trace the causes of deforestation.

The qualitative assessment of the resulting scientific model is based on Bordieu's work.
The concepts of social fields and habitus of different groups is a powerful tool to explore conflicts of interests related to deforestation in Brazil.

For the quantitative analysis, a subset of variables from the scientific model were selected by two criteria: (1) the variable can be represented in a structured numerical format; (2) the variable is assumed to have a causal effect on deforestation.
The second criterion relies on formal causal inference methods of variable selection, which is fundamental to create fair and robust statistical learning models.
Apart from using causality foundations to select variables, the quantitative analysis is based on a prediction modelling framework, composed by statistical learning algorithms.

Finally, the results from qualitative and quantitative assessments are compared and discussed in light with the literature.
Interpretation and discussion of results relies on a skeptical perspective of the models, which are a flawed representation of the phenomena of interest.
However, they still provide a useful source of information to advance the knowledge about the deforestation in the Amazon and Cerrado.

This is a work of exploratory nature, and avoids diagnostic prescription to solve the deforestation problem.
Instead, it presents a different framework to assess the phenomena, which relies on multiple areas of knowledge.
The document is likely to engage specially with readers with interest on deforestation, but it also provides rich material in the subjects of Critical Realism, Structuralism, Grounded Theory, Causal Inference and Machine Learning.

[^index-1]: I'm considering any type of natural vegetation suppression caused by human activity, including forest formations, shrublands and grasslands.

[^index-2]: The scientific model is the abstraction of the generative process that rules the observed phenomena.
    The scientific model defines the variables and their mutual relationships.
