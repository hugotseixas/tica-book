# Results

The study will present three main quantitative results based on quantitative data: predictions on vegetation suppression, land use transitions, and social and environmental variables. 
Our predictions on vegetation suppression will show the likelihood and extent of removal events, serving as a basis for predicting the land use changes of the affected grid cells. 
Finally, we will predict the impact of these findings on the environment and human well-being.

As part of the study, I will not only present the predictions generated by the models but also perform an in-depth analysis of the model's behavior. 
This analysis will provide a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms that drive the predictions and help to assess their reliability and accuracy.
Furthermore, based on my confidence in the models and their results, I will make inferences about the studied phenomena. 
This will allow me to go beyond the mere presentation of the predictions and offer insights into the relationships between the variables, the causes of the observed patterns, and the implications of the results for the environment and human well-being. 
However, it is important to note that I will only take this step if I feel confident in the models and their results, as making inferences requires a strong foundation of knowledge and understanding.
