    "section": "",
    "text": "Prefácio\nEsse trabalho é fruto de um esforço para desenvolver uma teoria interdisciplinar sobre a Supressão de Vegetação Natural (SVN)1. Uma teoria interdisciplinar seria aquela que consegue unir o conhecimento de diversas áreas de conhecimento (como a Sociologia, a Geografia e a Biologia). Caso uma teoria interdisciplinar seja bem sucedida, esperamos que ela possa fornecer uma nova perspectiva sobre um problema complexo (como a SVN), e possívelmente até servir de fomento para a idealização de novas soluções.1 Estou considerando a SVN como a supressão de qualquer tipo de vegetação considerada natural, causada pela atividade humana. Essas vegetações podem ser florestas, savanas, campos, pântanos ou qualquer outro tipo formação vegetal. Esse fenômeno também é geralmente chamado de desmatamento.\nUm ponto fundamental no desenvolvimento do modelo teórico desse trabalho, é de que a interdisciplinaridade pode ser concretizada a partir do uso de uma base filosófica comum, para a realização de análises de diferentes dimensões da realidade (dimensões sociais e ambientais, por exemplo). Através dessa proposta, espera-se criar uma situação propícia para a integração de conhecimentos, gerados por diferentes métodos de diferentes disciplinas, que a princípio seriam considerados incompatíveis.\nPara o desenvolvimento do modelo teórico, utilizarei uma base filosófica conhecida como Realismo Crítico. Essa base filosófica irá ditar a perspectiva de realidade adotada no trabalho, e também na forma em que as ferramentas metodológicas serão escolhidas e aplicadas.\nNo caso desse trabalho, escolhi a Teoria Geral dos Campos desenvolvida por Bourdieu para a realização de uma análise sociológica do problema da SVN, em sua dimensão social. Também adotei Modelagem Estatística de dados espaciais como método de análise da dimensão geográfica, que engloba caracteristicas biofísicas da superficie da terra, e de fronteiras políticas.\nA motivação das escolhas, feitas para estruturar a metodologia desse trabalho, veio da dificuldade da realização de uma análise aprofundada da SVN apenas através da utilização de métodos quantitativos sobre dados numéricos e estruturados. A SVN é um fenômeno que se materializa por dinâmicas sociais que dificilmente podem ser estimadas numéricamente e descritas por fórmulas matemáticas. Portanto a complementação de conhecimentos gerados por diferentes métodos é algo promissor para um entendimento mais aprofundado da SVN.\nPara a aplicação do modelo teórico, dois biomas brasileiros foram escolhidos para servir de contexto espacial e temporal. Os biomas são a Amazônia e o Cerrado (Figuras Figura 1 e Figura 2), ambos extremamente afetados pela SVN nas últimas décadas.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigura 1: Representação do Bioma Amazônia.\n\n\n\n\nA escolha desses biomas se deu pela oportunidade singular que eles oferecem, apesar de estarem no mesmo país, existem diferenças importantes entre ambos, como o tipo de vegetação e legislação. Portanto, existe uma facilidade de análise por se situarem em um mesmo país, ao mesmo tempo em que existe uma hetegeneidade causada pelas diferenças entre os biomas, algo de extrema importância para a aplicação de um modelo teórico que almeja ser considerado como uma Teoria Geral da SVN.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigura 2: Representation of the Cerrado biome.\n\n\n\n\nAs figuras acima representam a forma desse trabalho, no sentido de que existe uma união entre análises quantitativas usando dados espacialmente estruturados, e análises qualitativas que representam processos qua vão além de números, e incluem pessoas, comunidades, culturas, conflitos e alianças."

    "text": "A Supressão da Vegetação Nativa (SVN) é motivo de grande preocupação devido ao seu impacto sobre o meio ambiente e o bem-estar humano. Existe um interesse internacional na proteção de formações de vegetação natural, a fim de evitar efeitos negativos como emissões de gases de efeito estufa e a perda de biodiversidade. A compreensão das causas e das consequências deste fenômeno é crucial para orientar políticas destinadas a evitar uma maior SVN e a atenuar seus impactos negativos. No entanto, esta é uma tarefa difícil, uma vez que os fatores envolvidos neste fenômeno são diversos, heterogêneos e podem até ser contraditórios. Alguns dos fatores que já foram apontados como causas da SVN são: flutuações econômicas (Hargrave e Kis-Katos 2012), políticas de conservação (Pfaff et al. 2015), distribuição da população (Jusys 2016), posse da terra (Cattaneo 2001) e produção pecuária e agrícola (Bowman 2016). Por outro lado, já foi apontado que a SVN pode ter impacto na saúde humana (Santos e Almeida 2018), no regime climático (Silva, Lopes, e Santos 2023), na hidrologia regional (Cavalcante et al. 2019), nas propriedades do solo (Dias et al. 2022) e na biodiversidade (Gestich et al. 2021).\nQuando observamos esses fatores citados, percebemos a complexidade de processos que ocorrem em conjunto da SVN, sendo que esses processos podem ser analisados sob a perspectiva de diferentes disciplinas, como a Antropologia, Sociologia, Geografia, Economia, e Ecologia. No entanto, grande parte das pesquisas sobre a SVN tende a se concentrar em estudos que adotam apenas uma perspectiva do problema, em vez de adotar uma abordagem ampla (Turner et al. 2020), que consiga unir conhecimentos gerados por diferentes disciplinas, ou seja, interdisciplinar. Porém, desenvolver pesquisas interdisciplinares é um enorme desafio, sendo que não há consenso sobre a própria concepção do que se define como interdisciplinar (Zscheischler e Rogga 2015). Uma das possibilidades de se atingir esse patamar é de adotar um paradigma filosófico semelhante entre diferentes disciplinas (Danermark 2002), facilitando o diálogo entre conhecimentos gerados por diferentes métodos.\nA partir da problemática exposta acima, o presente trabalho tem como objetivo central, desenvolver e aplicar um Modelo Teórico Geral da SVN, que seja capaz de ser utilizado em análises por diferentes disciplinas. O desenvolvimento do modelo teórico é feito a partir de um paradigma filosófico conhecido como Realismo Crítico, que define a perspectiva ontológica e epistemológica adotada na pesquisa. A aplicação do modelo teórico é feita a partir do emprego da Teoria Geral dos Campos de Bourdieu, como uma perspectiva da Sociologia, e de modelos estatísticos espaciais, como uma perspectiva da Geografia. O contexto temporal e espacial da aplicação do modelo teórico se dá no passado recente dos biomas Amazônia e Cerrado,\nEspera-se que, a partir dos resultados das aplicações do modelo teórico, seja possível discutir novas possibilidades de intervenções para a prevenção da SVN nos biomas Amazônia e Cerrado.\n\nReferências\n\n\n\n\nBowman, Maria S. 2016. «Impact of foot-and-mouth disease status on deforestation in Brazilian Amazon and cerrado municipalities between 2000 and 2010».

    "text": "2.1 Theoretical Model\nThe theoretical model is created by the employment of an adaptation of the Critical Realist Grounded Theory. The method of Grounded Theory is widely used in social sciences with the objective of generating theories, it consists of an interactive and concurrent process of data collection and analysis. It have been modified trough time to accommodate different paradigms of research, such as the Critical Realism.\nThe Critical Realist Grounded Theory introduces the necessity to explicitly account for the link between observations and their underlying generative mechanisms, and the use of retroduction in order to abstract these mechanisms (Oliver 2011).\nThe process of data acquisition is performed by a series of interviews and literature assessment. The interviews inquire possible causes of NVS and the social groups related to this phenomena. After each interview, the answers are coded into general terms, and with related questions of how and why they can affect NVS. These questions are transformed into literature database queries, that helps finding written material that may enrich analysis with convergences or divergences with interview answers, or with new possible causes of NVS. After each round of interviews and literature assessment, the next interview may change to accommodate findings from the previous. This cyclic process is demonstrated in Figura 2.2.\n\n\n\n\n\nflowchart TD\n    A[Interview] --&gt; B[Data]\n    C[Questions] --&gt; D[Literature Assessment]\n    D --&gt; E[Data]\n    B --&gt; F[Theoretical Model]\n    F --&gt; C\n    E --&gt; F\n    F --&gt; A\n\n\n\nFigura 2.2: Workflow of theoretical model development\n\n\n\n\nThis process is repeated until the data from interviews and literature assessment starts to get redundant, adding little additional information to the theoretical model.\n\n2.1.1 Experts Interviews\nThe objective of the interviews is to explore a diverse range of possible causes of NVS.\nThe target participants are researchers with past experience on analyzing NVS in the Amazon or Cerrado biomes.\nThe prospecting of potential participants is done by snowball sampling.\nThe interviews consist of open and closed questions, and an interactive activity of building a DAG with the participants. The objective of developing DAGs with different participants is to explore a diversity of possibilities to theorize NVS causes. The use of DAGs before any modeling exercise (such as variables selection) is useful to reflect about the phenomena. It is also possible to compare DAGs (since they are graphs), so it will open an opportunity to explore convergences and divergences between participants.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportante\n\n\n\n\n\nREAD:\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.11157/fohpe.v20i3.387\nhttps://doi.org/10.1177/1468794118781718\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/S0167-9236(03)00095-2\nhttps://doi.org/10.1080/13645579.2021.1935565\nhttps://doi.org/10.1080/13645579.2020.1766777\nhttps://doi.org/10.1080/13645579.2018.1503400\n\n\n\n\nThe questions aims to develop a context of the participant experience and perspectives on NVS.\n\n\nWarning: `includeHTML()` was provided a `path` that appears to be a complete HTML document.\n✖ Path: ./figs/interview_schedule.html\nℹ Use `tags$iframe()` to include an HTML document.

However, it is performed as a complement to the reviews. The queries of the literature assessment are created based on reflections of the causal relationships identified in the interviews (e.g. if variable A is believed to cause B, what is the chain of events that allows this process?). Once the queries are created, a forward snowball search is performed, in which the resulting papers and its citing documents are screened.\n\n\n\n\n\nflowchart TD\n    A[Questions] --&gt; B[Query Development]\n    A[Questions] --&gt; C[Documents Screening]\n    B[Query Development] --&gt; D[Database Search]\n    D[Database Search] --&gt; C[Documents Screening]\n    C[Documents Screening] --&gt; E[Documents Collection]\n    E[Documents Collection] --&gt; F[Forward Snowball Search]\n    F[Forward Snowball Search] --&gt; C[Documents Screening]\n    E[Documents Collection] --&gt; G[Final Collection]\n\n\n\nFigura 2.3: Workflow of literature review\n\n\n\n\nThe relevant results from the literature are documented and stored for the creation of the theoretical model, in conjunction with the data acquired from the interviews.\n\n\n2.1.3 Variables description\nThe possible causes of NVS that are included in the theoretical model may or may not be observed as data, but all of them are described in this section.

The extent of the biomes have been changing over the years, and since we are working on a time series, the extent will dependent on the year. The biomes limits were defined by IBGE at 2004, and was updated in 2019.\nThe downloaded data was filtered to contain only the limits of the Amazon and Cerrado biomes.\n\n\n2.1.3.2 Natural Vegetation Suppression\nThe term of NVS is used to avoid the ambiguity of using the deforestation definition, recent research reviewed 65 reports, and found 15 definitions of deforestation, and 9 definitions of forests (Oca et al. 2021). There are also practical implications in how to identify NVS by satellite images, but in this project I simplify it by accounting for any non-trivial transition from natural vegetation to antropic land uses.\nThe NVS variable is derived from the MapBiomas land use and land cover collection (version 7.1).\nThe downloaded data was cropped to the extent of the Cerrado and Amazon biomes and projected to the SIRGAS 2000 / Brazil Policonic cartesian projection (EPSG:5880), which represents fixed area pixels in meters. Than the raster data was aggregated to a coarser spatial resolution, from 30 to 150 meters, assigning the value of the most frequent class to the new pixel (the mode of the 25 pixels that will be aggregated to the 150 meters pixels). This was done to reduce the amount of observations, which would be unfeasible to process, since the original data consists of hundreds of billions pixels.\nThe conversion from land use data to NVS is made for each grid cell. To perform this conversion, the downloaded raster files are cropped to the grid cell extent, and labeled in six groups: natural vegetation, pasture, temporary crops, perennial crops, forest plantation, and mosaic. The following step is to identify transitions between natural vegetation to antropic use, and calculate the area of those transitions for the grid cell. These transitions represents the NVS.\n\n\n2.1.3.3 Conservation Units\nThe limits of the Conservation Units (UC) are provided by the Ministry of Environment and Climate Change. These are the conservation units that finished the registration process at the National Register of Conservation Units (CNUC). However, the data used in this project is accessed by the Institute for Applied Economic Research (IPEA), which organizes data in a standard attributes and spatial projection. The data is represented as spatial vectors.\nThe UC vectors are intersected to the base grid, and the area of each UC inside each cell is calculated.\n\n\n2.1.3.4 Indigenous Lands\nThe limits of Indigenous Lands (IL) inside the Amazon and Cerrado are provided by FUNAI."

The analysis consists on defining a social field, its social rules, social actors within the field, and the power relationships between the actors.\nIn this project, the social field is idealized as an arena where NVS is materialized, in which I name as Land Use and Cover Field (LUCF). This field is where disputes over land happens. The concept of LUCF is broad, and may contain diverse types of disputes, however, in this work it is bounded to disputes related to NVS.\nThe social rules dictate the disputes inside the LUCF, and are not restrained only by the politics institutions and devices.\nSocial actors are conceptualized as groups of interest that represents not only individuals that share a common culture and goals, but also institutions.\nThe power of the social actors can manifest in different ways, such as economic, political, symbolic, social and cultural power.\nThe sociological analysis will consist in identifying the social actors and their power, for each cause of NVS (that were proposed in the theoretical model).

    "text": "2.3 Statistical Analysis\nThe statistical analysis is responsible for exploring relationships of observed variables within the exercise of predicting NVS. It is performed by structuring a database of observed variables that are considered to be a possible cause of the NVS, followed by a selection of variables according to the theoretical model, and finally the prediction of NVS.\n\n2.3.1 Database Structuring\nThe database contains data from different social and natural dimensions, which can be available in diverse formats and structures. To make the modeling process more efficient and transparent, all variables of interest must be organized coherently.\nThe process to create the database consists of accessing the data sources, downloading the data to the local environment, transforming and organizing the data to the grid, and store in the local environment.\n\n\n\n\n\nflowchart TD\n    A[Data Source] --&gt; E[Pre Processing]\n    B[Base Grid] --&gt; E[Pre Processing]\n    E[Pre Processing] --&gt; F[Gridded Data]\n    F[Gridded Data] --&gt; G[Database]\n\n\n\nFigura 2.4: Diagram of the process to create the project database.\n\n\n\n\nThe data are stored in a nested directories database with hive-style partitioning. The database is composed of a collection of parquet files, a format with high compression, that facilitates processing large volumes of data. The main partition stores the variables, which means that each variable will be stored in a separate directory. If necessary, the data will be partitioned by further variables (as a rule of thumb, each parquet file should not be smaller than 20MB and not bigger than 2GB).\nTo structure a collection of data that presents different natures, I must transform all the variables into a standard grid system. The grid system will be composed of 0.2 degrees cells (40km x 40km), which should be a balanced compromise between detail and computational cost.\nEach grid cell contains one observation, for each year, for all the variables.\n\n\n2.3.2 Model Development\nThe statistical model follow the standard approach to develop supervised models.\nThe variables selection will be performed according to available data of possible causes of NVS (as stated in the theoretical model), the selection will also be performed to remove variables that can induce unwanted bias in the results, such as colliders and mediators.\nThe data splitting between training and training, validation and testing groups will be performed in order to avoid spatial and temporal correlation between observations.\nThe parameters adjustments will be performed by cross validation methods for resampling and racing techniques for parameter optimization. In this process, validation data will be used for parameter adjustments.\nAfter the final model fit, accuracy metrics will be calculated in order to estimate the error of the statistical model. Along with the accuracy assessment, a series of model interpretation techniques will be applied in order to understand the model results.\nThe main steps are shown in Figura 2.5.\n\n\n\n\n\nflowchart TD\n    A[Database] --&gt; B[Variables Selection]\n    B[Variables Selection] --&gt; C[Data Split]\n    C[Data Split] --&gt; D[Training Data]\n    D[Training Data] --&gt; E[Pre Processing]\n    E[Pre Processing] --&gt; F[Initial Model Fit]\n    C[Data Split] --&gt; G[Validation Data]\n    C[Data Split] --&gt; H[Test Data]\n    F[Initial Model Fit] --&gt; I[Parameters Adjustments]\n    G[Validation Data] --&gt; I[Parameters Adjustments]\n    I[Parameters Adjustments] --&gt; J[Final Model Fit]\n    H[Test Data] --&gt; K[Model Assessment]\n    J[Final Model Fit] --&gt; K[Model Assessment]\n    J[Final Model Fit] --&gt; L[Model Interpretation]\n    K[Model Assessment] --&gt; L[Model Interpretation]\n\n\n\nFigura 2.5: Diagram of the modelling process.\n\n\n\n\nThe regression algorithms used to predict NVS are based on Decision Trees (DT) and ensemble techniques, that are Random Forest (RF), Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (BART) and Gradient Boosting Decision Trees (GBDT).

    "text": "3.1 Theoretical Model\nThe NVS Theoretical Model have the purpose to formally describe the phenomena manifestation process. Therefore, before presenting the model, it is necessary to revisit the concept of NVS being adopted.\nThe NVS, abbreviation for Natural Vegetation Suppression, is an action performed directly by humans, and consists of the transformation of an area occupied by natural vegetation. This transformation occurs by the removal of the natural vegetation to a degree in which the area is no longer recognized as a natural formation, by the human perception.\nTo describe the NVS Theoretical Model, I especulate about the causal mechanism that, when manifested, materializes the NVS.\nI propose four phenomena that composes the causal mechanism of NVS:\n\nValue: It is the possible values that can be attributed to a certain natural vegetation, occuping a certain space at a certain time;\nGains: The benefits that supressing a certain natural vegetation (in a certain space, at a certain time) may provide to the agent that is performing the action of supression;\nLosses: The drawbacks that may arise against the agent, as a concequence of its action of supression of a certain natural vegetation (in a certain space, at a certain time);\nWork: Is the physical manifestation of a social agent performing the action of natural vegetation suppression;\n\nThe causal mechanism is the relationship between the value of a natural vegetation, and the gain and losses of its suppression, followed the possibility of work. The NVS will be manifested when the causal mechanism is triggered, therefore, when there is a favorable opportunity, and there is the possibility of execution.\nAccording to the ontological paradigm being adopted, this causal mechanism lies in the domain of the real. I assume that it is absolute, in the sense that it do not change over time and space, and that the analysed phenomena (the NVS) is manifested only when this causal mechanism is triggered.\nThe causal mechanism is trigerred when a social agent and the natural vegetation exists in the same space and time, and when the dillema of the supression arises. The context of the situation in which the causal mechanism is triggrered will define the characteristics of value, gains, losses and work. This means that while the causal mechanism do not change over time and space, it will be manifested as different forms, depending of the context. The idea developed in this paragraph depicts the actual domain of the adopted ontology paradigm.\nThe form in which the NVS causal mechanism will manifest changes according to the situation context. The value of a natural vegetation, the gains and losses from its supression, and the work demanded for its execution are never the same, they are situational. The value of a natural vegetation can be easily represented by cultural aspects of social agents, while gains and losses can be represented as material and social capital, and work can be related to technology and momentum.\nHowever, how these aspects of the NVS causal mechanisms are perceived and interpreted by the social agents when it is trigerred is always partial. The social agent does not have access, or it is insensible, to certain values of the natural vegetation. The social agent has also a partial perception of gains and losses, it does not know all consequences of their action. At last, the work that executed the suppression is not always percepted, as it can be unintentional."

    "text": "3.3 Statistical Analysis\nIn this section I present the results from the quantitative analysis, from the exploratory data analysis to the statistical model predictions and interpretation.\n\n3.3.1 Exploratory Data Analysis\nIn this section I analyze each variable of my model. It is important to note that all quantitative analysis were performed in the data stored in the base grid. So the figures and tables do not show distributions of the raw observations/estimates, but the values that were transformed to fit the grid cells (?fig-base-grid).\nAll visualizations about the variables follows a common color scale, to facilitate their interpretation along the document (?fig-color-scale). The minimum values are represented by light gray color, values close to the median shows a yellow color, and maximum values as dark red color.\n\n3.3.1.1 Natural Vegetation Suppression\nThe NVS is the phenomena of interest of this project.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportante\n\n\n\n\n\nREAD:\n\nhttps://ssrn.com/abstract=4063325\nhttps://doi.org/10.1086/597794\nhttps://doi.org/10.1111/j.1475-682X.2007.00200.x\n\n\n\n\nIn the grid of analysis, the minimum area of NVS is 2 ha for the Amazon and Cerrado, and the maximum area is 18000 ha a year for the Amazon, and 12000 ha a year in the Cerrado ?tbl-deforestation-summary.\n\n\n\nThe distribution of NVS area in the grid cells is heavily skewed towards smaller areas, specially in the Amazon, which also shows a high frequency of a diverse range of values ?fig-deforestation-hist. The distribution of NVS for the Cerrado is less skewed, and show more frequent values close to 1000 ha a year ?fig-deforestation-hist.\nThe cumulative NVS area shows that grid cells with high values of NVS accounts for the majority of the total NVS in a year, for the Amazon NVS from 3000ha to 18000 ha, which are the 25% highest values, accounts for 79% of all NVS ?fig-deforestation-cumsum. For the Cerrado, NVS from 900 ha to 12000 ha, the 25% highest values, accounts for 57% of the total NVS ?fig-deforestation-cumsum.\nThe spatial distribution of NVS shows a concentration in some regions of the Amazon, specially in areas in proximity to the Cerrado biome ?fig-deforestation-spatial-distribution. However, the distribution of NVS in the Cerrado shows a different pattern, where the NVS occurrence is spread in the whole biome ?fig-deforestation-spatial-distribution.\nThe NVS time series shows periods of increase of NVS in the Amazon from 1985 to 2003, followed by a consistent drop of NVS area after 2003 Figura 3.1. For the Cerrado, the NVS area have been decreasing since the start of the time series, with some periods of increase in 2004 and 2013.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigura 3.1: Time series of natural vegetation suppression area.\n\n\n\n\nThe natural vegetation types that suffered suppression are Forests, Grasslands, Savannas and Wetlands. In the Amazon, the majority of NVS occurs over Forests, and in the Cerrado it occurrence is predominant over Savannas ?fig-deforestation-colsum-natural.\nThe antropic land uses that followed after NVS are predominantly Pastures for both biomes ?fig-deforestation-colsum-human. However, Mosaic of Uses and Temporary Crops share a significant amount of NVS area in the Cerrado ?fig-deforestation-colsum-human.\n\n\n3.3.1.2 Conservation Units\nThe creation of conservation units is a main strategy to protect natural landscapes in Brazil. The creation of protected areas in Brazil dates from 1896, with the creation of the first National Park in São Paulo (Drummond, Andrade Franco, e Ninis 2009), however, it was only in 2000 that a law was approved to create a system to organize and regulate the UCs, named as the National System of Conservation Units (SNUC) (Drummond, Andrade Franco, e Ninis 2009; Borges, Rezende, e Pereira 2009; Moreira et al. 2021). The SNUC comprises federal, state and municipal UCs of different characteristics (Borges, Rezende, e Pereira 2009).\nIn the grid of analysis, the maximum area occupied by UC in a single cell is 78000 ha, which is the total cell area ?fig-uc-summary. The majority of cells do not present any area of UC ?fig-uc-summary.\nWhen analyzing the grid cells with any cover of UC, we observe that in the Amazon, most those grid cells are fully occupied by UC ?fig-uc-hist. The situation is very different for the Cerrado, where most pixels occupied by UC shows small areas, indicating that small UC are more frequent for this biome ?fig-uc-hist.\nThe spatial distributions of UC in the Amazon and Cerrado are very different. In the Amazon it is possible to observe a large number of big UC, while in Cerrado most of UC are smaller as scattered around the biome ?fig-uc-spatial-distribution.\nThe time series of accumulated UC area over time shows a steady increase from 1985 to 2010, followed by a period of stagnation of the creation of new UC for the Amazon and Cerrado ?fig-uc-timeseries.\n\n\n3.3.1.3 Policies\nThere are a large number of laws, decrees, resolutions and commitments made in Brazil with the objective to decrease NVS. These are organized in a timeline with some key policies related to NVS ?fig-pp-timeline.\n\n\n\nThe details of these policies are summarized in the ?tbl-timeline, which shows the beggining and end of the policy, their spatial coverage and a general description."

It is a perspective that negates the duality between the social and the natural, as also negates the determination of the social by the natural (Gorski 2013), and neither the other way around (Fletcher 2016). Instead, its focus is on the inference of causal mechanisms (Lawani 2020), which dictates the natural and the social altogether. In this section, I define the ontology and epistemology, based on the paradigm of critical realism, adopted in this work, and how they justify the methodology.\n\nOntology: There are three ontological domains, in other words, reality is stratified: the domain of the real, formed by the generative mechanisms that act as causal forces to produce events (Fletcher 2016); the domain of the actual, that contains the realization of the real domain, when the generative mechanisms are activated and occurs whether or not these realizations can be perceived or measured; the domain of the empirical where the actual domain is observed, in other words, is where the events caused by the activation of generative mechanisms of the real domain are perceived or measured;\nEpistemology: Knowldge is obtained by interpreting patterns and tendencies of perceived and measured events, with the objective of explaining the phenomena of interest by the generative mechanisms that dictates it (Lawani 2020; Wynn and Williams 2012).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\n\n\nREAD:\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1007/s11191-018-9983-x\n\n\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-019-7760-7\nhttps://doi.org/10.1177/15586898211049847\nhttps://doi.org/10.1558/aleth.v5i1.56\nhttps://doi.org/10.1177/1368431015590700\nhttps://doi.org/10.1111/1468-5914.00127\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.cpa.2016.03.001\nhttps://doi.org/10.1111/1467-954X.00407\nhttps://doi.org/10.1558/jcr.v3i1.133\nhttps://doi.org/10.1111/0735-2751.00064\nhttps://doi.org/10.1177/0018726718767952"

Bourdieu is a recognized sociologist that influenced the Sociological Field Theory, having developed the concepts of field, habitus, capital and doxa. His theory is widely applied in diverse areas of study due to its generalized nature.\nThe concept of field in the perspective of Bourdieu is that fields are arenas of disputes between different social actors (Kluttz and Fligstein 2016). The social actors occupy a certain position in the field, and are in dispute towards an objective at stake (Thomson 2014). Each field functions according to it’s own logic, or in other words, present specific “rules of the game” (Kluttz and Fligstein 2016; Thomson 2014).\nThe capital is the manifestation of different types of power, that can be economic, cultural or social (Kluttz and Fligstein 2016).\nThe habitus is a property of social actors, that along with the capital and the field, shapes the practices of these social actors (Maton 2014). It describes a dynamic process of action performed in the field, formed by subjective constructions and objective dispositions, in a sense that the habitus of these social actors is affected by and also affects the social structures of a field (Kluttz and Fligstein 2016).\nThe doxa can be considered as implicit rules operating within a field.

    "text": "A.3 Statistical Modeling\nStatistical modeling can be useful for explaining and predicting an observable phenomena. When creating a statistical model, we accept (implicitly or explicitly) a diverse number of assumptions that should be true for the model to represent reality correctly. However, the correctness of all the assumptions is impossible, so we are limited to make estimations about the phenomena of interest. Following this reasoning, we should not condition the reality to the statistical models that we create, in reality, it should be the other way around, theories about reality should condition our statistical models.\nThe use of statistical causal inference methods is a possible way to develop a statistical model informed by causal theory, and is usually applied when the objective is to explain certain phenomena. Statistical algorithms can also be used solely for prediction, with the goal of minimizing prediction errors, but not taking to account causal mechanisms of the phenomena of interest. However, both approaches do not need to be completely separated, prediction exercises can also be informed by causal inference techniques, in order to create fair statistical models, which can be useful for exploration of a phenomena.\nThe statistical perspective is coherent with the ontological perspective of Critical Realism. Statistical inference aims to propose models of data generating process, which are the causal mechanisms that forms the real domain. In statistics we are only able to perform these inferences based on observable events triggered by the activation of certain causal mechanisms, and our estimations of that event is an imperfect representation of the actual domain. The “distance” between the empirical and the actual domains is defined as the error of a statistical model, and integrates estimates and model errors."

    "section": "2.1 Modelo Teórico",
    "text": "2.1 Modelo Teórico\nO modelo teórico é desenvolvido com base em informações obtidas da literatura técnica e científica e entrevistas realisadas com pesquisadores que atuam no tema da SVN. Porém, o desenvolvimento desse modelo teórico também é fortemente afetado pelas minhas experiências pessoais, como exposição à noticias, discussões diversas sobre o tema, e reflexões e indagações pessoais. Portanto, o conteúdo gerado nessa parte da pesquisa não pode ser considerada como produto de um método sistemático e reproduzível. Porém, apesar de se caracterizar como um processo um tanto ametódico, o desenvolvimento do modelo teórico segue uma maneira de se refletir sobre um fenômeno, se inspira em certas proposições metodológicas, e se baseia parcialmente, em uma limitada sistematização de informações.\nA maneira de se refletir sobre um fenômeno, adotada nesse trabalho, é baseada na idéia de retrodução do Realismo Crítico. A retrodução pode ser definida como uma atividade de imaginação em que pensamos nos mecanismos generativos que, se de fato forem reais, irão causar um fenômeno quando tais mecanismos forem manifestados (Bhaskar 2016, 3). A prática da retrodução implica em um exercício de imaginação que tenta transitar entre os domínios ontológicos do Realismo Crítico, o domínio do empírico, o domínio do atual e o domínio do real (Akram 2023, 53–54). Uma ilustração geral e superficial do exercício de retrodução feita nessa pesquisa pode ser feita da seguinte forma: em um cenário hipotético, acredita-se que os É a integração de conhecimentos sobre determinado objeto intransitivo, a socialização de tudo que percebemos. Por exemplo, se pensarmos em uma rodovia: o que define ela como rodovia, pra que ela serve, a relação dela com demais objetos, essas são definições sociais que representam a idéia de rodovia como um objeto transitivo.objetos transitivos A e B sejam causadores da SVN; a partir disso, nos questionamos quais seriam as condições necessárias para que essa relação de A e a SVN se manifeste; essas condições são traduzidas como o mecanismo generativo proposto; por consequência, nos questionamos se tal mecanismo generativo consegue explicar a relação de causa de B e a SVN. Esse exercício é repetido em qualquer ordem, e a medida que esse processo se sucede, lacunas do mecanismo generativo podem ser identificadas e retificadas, assim como inconsistências podem ser eliminadas, se possível.\nO desenvolvimento do modelo teórico também incorpora algumas idéias do método da Teoria Fundamentada, e mais especificamente desse método baseado no Realismo Crítico, como proposto por Oliver (2011). Nesse projeto, a condução de entrevistas e consultas da literatura são sistematizadas em forma de dados qualitativos estruturados, contendo as idéias centrais obtidas a partir desses materiais. Essa sistematização de dados é feita de maneira concomitante com o desenvolvimento do modelo teórico.\nThe theoretical model is created by the employment of an adaptation of the Critical Realist Grounded Theory. The method of Grounded Theory is widely used in social sciences with the objective of generating theories, it consists of an interactive and concurrent process of data collection and analysis. It have been modified trough time to accommodate different paradigms of research, such as the Critical Realism.\nThe Critical Realist Grounded Theory introduces the necessity to explicitly account for the link between observations and their underlying generative mechanisms, and the use of retroduction in order to abstract these mechanisms (Oliver 2011).\nThe process of data acquisition is performed by a series of interviews and literature assessment. The interviews inquire possible causes of NVS and the social groups related to this phenomena. After each interview, the answers are coded into general terms, and with related questions of how and why they can affect NVS. These questions are transformed into literature database queries, that helps finding written material that may enrich analysis with convergences or divergences with interview answers, or with new possible causes of NVS. After each round of interviews and literature assessment, the next interview may change to accommodate findings from the previous. This cyclic process is demonstrated in Figura 2.2.\n\n\n\n\n\nflowchart TD\n    A[Interview] --&gt; B[Data]\n    C[Questions] --&gt; D[Literature Assessment]\n    D --&gt; E[Data]\n    B --&gt; F[Theoretical Model]\n    F --&gt; C\n    E --&gt; F\n    F --&gt; A\n\n\n\nFigura 2.2: Workflow of theoretical model development\n\n\n\n\nThis process is repeated until the data from interviews and literature assessment starts to get redundant, adding little additional information to the theoretical model.\n\n2.1.1 Experts Interviews\nThe objective of the interviews is to explore a diverse range of possible causes of NVS.\nThe target participants are researchers with past experience on analyzing NVS in the Amazon or Cerrado biomes.\nThe prospecting of potential participants is done by snowball sampling.\nThe interviews consist of open and closed questions, and an interactive activity of building a DAG with the participants. The objective of developing DAGs with different participants is to explore a diversity of possibilities to theorize NVS causes. The use of DAGs before any modeling exercise (such as variables selection) is useful to reflect about the phenomena. It is also possible to compare DAGs (since they are graphs), so it will open an opportunity to explore convergences and divergences between participants.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportante\n\n\n\n\n\nREAD:\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.11157/fohpe.v20i3.387\nhttps://doi.org/10.1177/1468794118781718\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/S0167-9236(03)00095-2\nhttps://doi.org/10.1080/13645579.2021.1935565\nhttps://doi.org/10.1080/13645579.2020.1766777\nhttps://doi.org/10.1080/13645579.2018.1503400\n\n\n\n\nThe questions aims to develop a context of the participant experience and perspectives on NVS.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  Tabela 2.1:  Interview schedule used in this project. \n  \n  \n    \n      Opening\n    \n    My name is Hugo Tameirão Seixas, I’m a doctorate student leading a research on modeling natural vegetation suppression in the Amazon and Cerrado.\nEstablish rapport\n    Thank you so much for agreeing to this interview.

However, it is performed as a complement to the reviews. The queries of the literature assessment are created based on reflections of the causal relationships identified in the interviews (e.g. if variable A is believed to cause B, what is the chain of events that allows this process?). Once the queries are created, a forward snowball search is performed, in which the resulting papers and its citing documents are screened.\n\n\n\n\n\nflowchart TD\n    A[Questions] --&gt; B[Query Development]\n    A[Questions] --&gt; C[Documents Screening]\n    B[Query Development] --&gt; D[Database Search]\n    D[Database Search] --&gt; C[Documents Screening]\n    C[Documents Screening] --&gt; E[Documents Collection]\n    E[Documents Collection] --&gt; F[Forward Snowball Search]\n    F[Forward Snowball Search] --&gt; C[Documents Screening]\n    E[Documents Collection] --&gt; G[Final Collection]\n\n\n\nFigura 2.3: Workflow of literature review\n\n\n\n\nThe relevant results from the literature are documented and stored for the creation of the theoretical model, in conjunction with the data acquired from the interviews.\n\n\n2.1.3 Variables description\nThe possible causes of NVS that are included in the theoretical model may or may not be observed as data, but all of them are described in this section. The variables may present diverse nature, such as quantitative and qualitative.\n\n\nWarning: `includeHTML()` was provided a `path` that appears to be a complete HTML document.\n✖ Path: ./figs/variables_table.html\nℹ Use `tags$iframe()` to include an HTML document. You can either ensure `path` is accessible in your app or document (see e.g. `shiny::addResourcePath()`) and pass the relative path to the `src` argument.

The extent of the biomes have been changing over the years, and since we are working on a time series, the extent will dependent on the year. The biomes limits were defined by IBGE at 2004, and was updated in 2019.\nThe downloaded data was filtered to contain only the limits of the Amazon and Cerrado biomes.\n\n\n2.1.3.2 Natural Vegetation Suppression\nThe term of NVS is used to avoid the ambiguity of using the deforestation definition, recent research reviewed 65 reports, and found 15 definitions of deforestation, and 9 definitions of forests (Oca et al. 2021). There are also practical implications in how to identify NVS by satellite images, but in this project I simplify it by accounting for any non-trivial transition from natural vegetation to antropic land uses.\nThe NVS variable is derived from the MapBiomas land use and land cover collection (version 7.1).\nThe downloaded data was cropped to the extent of the Cerrado and Amazon biomes and projected to the SIRGAS 2000 / Brazil Policonic cartesian projection (EPSG:5880), which represents fixed area pixels in meters. Than the raster data was aggregated to a coarser spatial resolution, from 30 to 150 meters, assigning the value of the most frequent class to the new pixel (the mode of the 25 pixels that will be aggregated to the 150 meters pixels). This was done to reduce the amount of observations, which would be unfeasible to process, since the original data consists of hundreds of billions pixels.\nThe conversion from land use data to NVS is made for each grid cell. To perform this conversion, the downloaded raster files are cropped to the grid cell extent, and labeled in six groups: natural vegetation, pasture, temporary crops, perennial crops, forest plantation, and mosaic. The following step is to identify transitions between natural vegetation to antropic use, and calculate the area of those transitions for the grid cell. These transitions represents the NVS.\n\n\n2.1.3.3 Conservation Units\nThe limits of the Conservation Units (UC) are provided by the Ministry of Environment and Climate Change. These are the conservation units that finished the registration process at the National Register of Conservation Units (CNUC). However, the data used in this project is accessed by the Institute for Applied Economic Research (IPEA), which organizes data in a standard attributes and spatial projection. The data is represented as spatial vectors.\nThe UC vectors are intersected to the base grid, and the area of each UC inside each cell is calculated.\n\n\n2.1.3.4 Indigenous Lands\nThe limits of Indigenous Lands (IL) inside the Amazon and Cerrado are provided by FUNAI."
