    "section": "",
    "text": "Preface\nThis work is an effort to develop an interdisciplinary approach to analyse social and environmental dimensions related to deforestation1 in the Amazon and Cerrado biomes. The main objective is to use qualitative and quantitative methods to explore causes of deforestation in these areas, and uncover underlying social conflicts that emerge and shape this phenomena.1 I’m considering any type of natural vegetation suppression caused by human activity, including forest formations, shrublands and grasslands.\nThe motivation to develop this research is to account for a diversity of factors involved in the deforestation process. When analyzing social and environmental variables, we must always remember what lies hidden in numerical values, individuals, relationships, culture, landscapes. Is it possible to avoid omitting these when conducting research at large scales? How to represent them inside structured data formats?\nThe fact is that is usually not possible to abstract certain phenomena in a quantitative framework. That’s why interdisciplinary approaches, using qualitative and quantitative methods, can support deep and rich analysis about complex and dynamic processes, such as deforestation.\nIn this work, I try to perform such task by running parallel analysis of different dimensions, but based in common grounds. Such as Figure 1 and Figure 2, this project is composed by numerical analysis of structured spatial data (represented as regular grid cells), as also by sociological investigation of social and environmental processes that can’t be measured.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Representation of the Amazon biome. TODO Describe some of the images inside the cells.\n\n\n\n\nBefore diving into this work, I would like to first introduce some key foundations adopted in my research.\nAs a philosophical background for the work, I have adopted the perspective of Critical Realism, which focuses on causal analysis in the social field. This is the umbrella for the thesis, and the perspective I use both in planning the analysis and interpreting my results.\nThe information gathering to create my scientific model2 is based on Grounded Theory”, which is a general method to gather data in qualitative studies and test theories. I have adapted this method to gather data from interviews and the literature, in order to trace the causes of deforestation.2 The scientific model is the abstraction of the generative process that rules the observed phenomena. The scientific model defines the variables and their mutual relationships.\nThe qualitative assessment of the resulting scientific model is based on Bordieu’s work. The concepts of social fields and habitus of different groups is a powerful tool to explore conflicts of interests related to deforestation in Brazil.\nFor the quantitative analysis, a subset of variables from the scientific model were selected by two criteria: (1) the variable can be represented in a structured numerical format; (2) the variable is assumed to have a causal effect on deforestation. The second criterion relies on formal causal inference methods of variable selection, which is fundamental to create fair and robust statistical learning models. Apart from using causality foundations to select variables, the quantitative analysis is based on a prediction modelling framework, composed by statistical learning algorithms.\nFinally, the results from qualitative and quantitative assessments are compared and discussed in light with the literature. Interpretation and discussion of results relies on a skeptical perspective of the models, which are a flawed representation of the phenomena of interest. However, they still provide a useful source of information to advance the knowledge about the deforestation in the Amazon and Cerrado.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Representation of the Cerrado biome. TODO Describe some of the images inside the cells.\n\n\n\n\nThis is a work of exploratory nature, and avoids diagnostic prescription to solve the deforestation problem. Instead, it presents a different framework to assess the phenomena, which relies on multiple areas of knowledge. The document is likely to engage specially with readers with interest on deforestation, but it also provides rich material in the subjects of Critical Realism, Structuralism, Grounded Theory, Causal Inference and Machine Learning."

    "text": "The suppression of native vegetation in the Amazon and Cerrado biomes is a matter of great concern due to its potential impact on the environment and human well-being. Understanding the drivers and effects of this phenomenon is crucial to guide policies to avoid further natural vegetation suppression and mitigate negative impacts. However, this is a challenging task since the factors involved in this phenomenon are diverse, heterogeneous, and can even be contradictory. Existing literature suggests that native vegetation suppression is caused by economic fluctuations (Hargrave and Kis-Katos 2012), conservation policies (Pfaff et al. 2015), population distribution (Jusys 2016), land tenure (Cattaneo 2001), livestock and crop productions (Bowman 2016). On the other side, vegetation removal may impact human health (Santos and Almeida 2018), climate regime (Silva, Lopes, and Santos 2023), regional hydrology (Cavalcante et al. 2019), soil properties (Dias et al. 2022) and biodiversity (Gestich et al. 2021).\nUnfortunately, much of the research in this area tends to focus on only a few dimensions of the problem, rather than taking a holistic approach. This narrow focus often fails to capture the full extent of the issue and can lead to oversimplifications or misdirection in efforts to solve it.\nThis project aims to predict and understand the causes and impacts of native vegetation suppression in the Cerrado and Amazon biomes, considering environmental and anthropic dimensions. The results will provide a deeper understanding of the relationships between land use changes, environmental factors, and social dynamics related to native vegetation suppression.\nRegression and classification models will be applied to existing data on land use changes, environmental factors, and social variables in the Cerrado and Amazon biomes. The models will be used to identify patterns and relationships between these variables.\nThe results of this project will contribute to a better understanding of the causes and impacts of native vegetation suppression in the Cerrado and Amazon biomes. This knowledge will inform the development of effective conservation and management strategies that will help to protect these vital and unique ecosystems.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\n\n\nREAD: land use theory\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.futures.2014.11.005\nhttps://doi.org/10.1080/1747423X.2020.1811792\n\n\n\n\n\n2 Objectives\nThe main objective of this project is to develop a framework to model deforestation and its impacts, using variables of different dimensions (environment and society) to predict quantitative estimations of deforestation and its social and environmental impacts.

My aim is to analyze the potential advantages and limitations of the methodology I have developed through this comparison.\nIn addition to comparing the results of my models with previous research, I will also be exploring the practical implications of the findings. Specifically, I will be examining how the results can be used to inform and support decision making, particularly when dealing with complex environmental and human well-being issues that involve multiple dimensions. In many cases, decision making related to vegetation removals and their impact on the environment and human well-being can be challenging due to the multiple and sometimes conflicting factors that need to be considered.\nThe findings can be used to identify the most significant factors that contribute to vegetation removals and their impact on the environment and human well-being, as well as how these factors interact with one another. This information can then be used to prioritize the most pressing issues and to design targeted interventions and strategies to mitigate the negative effects of vegetation removals."

My aim is to analyze the potential advantages and limitations of the methodology I have developed through this comparison.\nIn addition to comparing the results of my models with previous research, I will also be exploring the practical implications of the findings. Specifically, I will be examining how the results can be used to inform and support decision making, particularly when dealing with complex environmental and human well-being issues that involve multiple dimensions. In many cases, decision making related to vegetation removals and their impact on the environment and human well-being can be challenging due to the multiple and sometimes conflicting factors that need to be considered.\nThe findings can be used to identify the most significant factors that contribute to vegetation removals and their impact on the environment and human well-being, as well as how these factors interact with one another. This information can then be used to prioritize the most pressing issues and to design targeted interventions and strategies to mitigate the negative effects of vegetation removals."

Our predictions on vegetation suppression will show the likelihood and extent of removal events, serving as a basis for predicting the land use changes of the affected grid cells. Finally, we will predict the impact of these findings on the environment and human well-being.\nAs part of the study, I will not only present the predictions generated by the models but also perform an in-depth analysis of the model’s behavior. This analysis will provide a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms that drive the predictions and help to assess their reliability and accuracy. Furthermore, based on my confidence in the models and their results, I will make inferences about the studied phenomena. This will allow me to go beyond the mere presentation of the predictions and offer insights into the relationships between the variables, the causes of the observed patterns, and the implications of the results for the environment and human well-being.
