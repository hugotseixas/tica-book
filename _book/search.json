    "section": "",
    "text": "Preface\nThis project is an effort to develop an interdisciplinary approach to modelling land use and land cover transitions and their impact to social and environmental dimensions. This document is a register of a modelling exercise that will not only select the most important variables, fine tune model parameters, and find the algorithms that return the best accuracy metrics. It will also be a journey to understand the sociological dynamics of land use changes, and hopefully will establish evidence to support natural resources governance.\nI will explore two Brazilian biomes, the Amazon, which is a very common topic when talking about the environment, the whole world pays attention to this important forest. And the Cerrado, an equally important ecosystem, but often neglected.\nThe Amazon is the largest rainforest in the world, covering an area of approximately 6.7 million square kilometers, and is home to an estimated 10% of the world’s known species of plants and animals. It is characterized by its dense forests, towering trees, and rich biodiversity. It is home to numerous species of mammals, birds, reptiles, and insects. The Amazon biome is facing significant threats from deforestation, climate change, and illegal activities such as logging, mining, and agriculture.\n\nThe Cerrado is the second-largest biome in Brazil, and it is characterized by its diverse flora and fauna, as well as its unique landscape of rolling hills, plateaus, and plains. It is also an important area for agriculture, with large areas of the region being used for soybean, corn, and cattle production. However, the rapid expansion of agriculture in the region has also led to deforestation and habitat destruction, threatening the unique biodiversity of the biome."

    "text": "The suppression of native vegetation in the Cerrado and Amazon biomes is a matter of great concern due to its potential impact on the environment and human well-being. Understanding the drivers and effects of this phenomenon is crucial to guide policies to avoid natural vegetation suppression and mitigate negative impacts. However, this is a challenging task since the factors involved in this phenomenon are diverse, heterogeneous, and can even be contradictory. Existing literature suggests that native vegetation suppression is caused by economic fluctuations (Hargrave and Kis-Katos 2012), conservation policies (Pfaff et al. 2015), population distribution (Jusys 2016), land tenure (Cattaneo 2001), livestock and crop productions (Bowman 2016). On the other side, vegetation removal may impact human health (Santos and Almeida 2018), climate regime (Silva, Lopes, and Santos 2023), regional hydrology (Cavalcante et al. 2019), soil properties (Dias et al. 2022), biodiversity (Gestich et al. 2021).\nUnfortunately, much of the research in this area tends to focus on only a few dimensions of the problem, rather than taking a holistic approach. This narrow focus often fails to capture the full extent of the issue and can lead to oversimplifications or misdirection in efforts to solve it.\nThis project aims to predict and understand the causes and impacts of native vegetation suppression in the Cerrado and Amazon biomes, considering environmental and anthropic dimensions. The results will provide a deeper understanding of the relationships between land use changes, environmental factors, and social dynamics related to native vegetation suppression.\nRegression and classification models will be applied to existing data on land use changes, environmental factors, and social variables in the Cerrado and Amazon biomes. The models will be used to identify patterns and relationships between these variables and to predict future trends.\nThe results of this project will contribute to a better understanding of the causes and impacts of native vegetation suppression in the Cerrado and Amazon biomes. This knowledge will inform the development of effective conservation and management strategies that will help to protect these vital and unique ecosystems.\n\n\n\n\nBowman, Maria S. 2016. “Impact of Foot-and-Mouth Disease Status on Deforestation in Brazilian Amazon and Cerrado Municipalities Between 2000 and 2010.” Journal of Environmental Economics and Management 75 (January). https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jeem.2015.08.003.\n\n\nCattaneo, Andrea. 2001. “Deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon: Comparing the Impacts of Macroeconomic Shocks, Land Tenure, and Technological Change.” Land Economics 77 (2). https://doi.org/10.2307/3147091.\n\n\nCavalcante, R.

To make the modeling process more efficient and transparent, all variables of interest must be organized coherently. To structure a collection of data that presents different natures, I will transform all the variables into a standard grid system. The grid system will be composed of 0.2 degrees cells (40km x 40km), which should be a balanced compromise between detail and computational cost.\n\n\n\nRepresentation of the spatial grid that will be used to store the data from different sources.\n\n\nEach grid cell will contain an observation, for each year, for all the variables. Only pixels that contained natural vegetation in the first year of the analysis will be considered valid.\nThe process to create the database will consist of accessing the data sources, downloading the data to the local environment, transforming and organizing the data to the grid (if the data source provides any pre-processing tool before downloading the data, it should be done that way), and store in the local environment.\n\n\n\n\n%%{init: {'theme': 'neutral' } }%%\n\nflowchart TD\n    A[Data Source] --> E[Pre Processing]\n    B[Base Grid] --> E[Pre Processing]\n    E[Pre Processing] --> F[Gridded Data]\n    F[Gridded Data] --> G[Database]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe data will be stored in a nested directories database with hive-style partitioning. The database will be composed of a collection of parquet files, a format with high compression, that facilitates processing large volumes of data. The main partition will be the variables, which means that each variable will be stored in a separate directory. If necessary, the data will be partitioned by further variables (as a rule of thumb, each parquet file should not be smaller than 20MB and not bigger than 2GB).\n\n3.3.1 Variables\n\n3.3.1.1 Deforestation\nThe deforestation variable is derived from the MapBiomas land use and land cover collection.\nThe downloaded data was cropped to the extent of the Cerrado and Amazon biomes. Than the raster data was aggregated to a coarser spatial resolution, from 30 to 300 meters, assigning the value of the most frequent class to the new pixel (the mode of the 100 pixels that will be aggregated to the 300 meters pixels). This was done to reduce the amount of observations, which would be unfeasible to process, since the original data consists of hundreds of billions pixels.\n\n\n3.3.1.2 Conservation Units\nThe conservation units are downloaded from IBGE."

To achieve this, the model will be adjusted to present the minimum inclusion error for class “1”, and the probability threshold to classify an observation as class “1” will be a higher value.\nThe second model will predict the amount of vegetation suppression that was classified with the label “1” in the previous model.

By using these techniques, I aim to gain a deeper understanding of the relationships between the variables and how they contribute to the predictions. This information will enable assessing the reliability of the models and validity of their results."

In many cases, decision making related to vegetation removals and their impact on the environment and human well-being can be challenging due to the multiple and sometimes conflicting factors that need to be considered.\nThe findings can be used to identify the most significant factors that contribute to vegetation removals and their impact on the environment and human well-being, as well as how these factors interact with one another. This information can then be used to prioritize the most pressing issues and to design targeted interventions and strategies to mitigate the negative effects of vegetation removals."
