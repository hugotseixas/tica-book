    "text": "Preface\nThis work is an effort to develop an interdisciplinary approach to analyze social and environmental dimensions related to Natural Vegetation Supression (NVS)1 in the Amazon and Cerrado biomes. The main objective is to use qualitative and quantitative methods to explore causes of NVS in these areas, and uncover underlying social conflicts that emerge and shape this phenomena.1 I’m considering any type of natural vegetation suppression caused by human activity, including forest formations, shrublands and grasslands. This is also usually named as deforestation.\nThe motivation to develop this research is to account for a diversity of factors involved in the NVS process. When analyzing social and environmental variables, we must always remember what lies hidden in numerical values, individuals, relationships, culture, landscapes. Is it possible to avoid omitting these when conducting research at large scales? How to represent them inside structured data formats?\nThe fact is that is usually not possible to abstract certain processes in a quantitative framework. That’s why interdisciplinary approaches, using qualitative and quantitative methods, can support deep and rich analysis about complex and dynamic processes, such as NVS.\nIn this work, I try to perform such task by running parallel analysis of different dimensions, but based in common grounds. Such as Figure 1 and Figure 2, this project is composed by numerical analysis of structured spatial data (represented as regular grid cells), as also by sociological investigation of social and environmental processes that can’t be measured.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Representation of the Brazilian Amazon biome.\n\n\n\n\nBefore diving into this work, I would like to first introduce some key foundations adopted in my research (see more at Appendix A).\nAs a philosophical background for the work, I have adopted the perspective of Critical Realism (see Section A.1), which focuses the reflection about causal mechanisms. This is the research paradigm for the thesis, and the perspective I use both in planning the analysis and interpreting my results.\nThe information gathering to create my scientific model2 is based on Grounded Theory”, which is a general method to gather data in qualitative studies and test theories. I have adapted this method to gather data from interviews and the literature, in order to trace the causes of deforestation.2 The scientific model is the abstraction of the generative process that rules the observed phenomena. The scientific model defines the variables and their mutual relationships.\nThe qualitative assessment of the resulting scientific model is based on the Sociological Field Theory in the perspective of Bordieu’s work (see Section A.2). The concepts of social fields and habitus of different social actors is a powerful tool to explore underlying mechanisms related to NVS in Brazil.\nFor the quantitative analysis (see Section A.3), a subset of variables from the scientific model were selected by two criteria: (1) the variable can be represented in a structured numerical format; (2) the variable is assumed to have a causal effect on NVS. The second criterion relies on formal causal inference methods of variable selection, which is fundamental to create fair and robust statistical learning models. Apart from using causality foundations to select variables, the quantitative analysis is based on a prediction modeling framework, composed by statistical learning algorithms.\nFinally, the results from qualitative and quantitative assessments are compared and discussed in light with the literature. Interpretation and discussion of results relies on a skeptical perspective of the models, which are a flawed representation of the phenomena of interest. However, they still provide a useful source of information to advance the knowledge about the NVS in the Amazon and Cerrado.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Representation of the Cerrado biome.\n\n\n\n\nThis is a work of exploratory nature, and avoids diagnostic prescription to solve the NVS problem. Instead, it presents a different framework to assess the phenomena, which relies on multiple areas of knowledge. The document is likely to engage specially with readers with interest on NVS, but it also provides rich material to the subjects of Critical Realism, Sociological Field Theory, Grounded Theory, Causal Inference and Machine Learning."

    "text": "2.1 Theoretical Model\nThe theoretical model is created by the employment of an adaptation of the Critical Realist Grounded Theory. The method of Grounded Theory is widely used in social sciences with the objective of generating theories, it consists of an interactive and concurrent process of data collection and analysis. It have been modified trough time to accommodate different paradigms of research, such as the Critical Realism.\nThe Critical Realist Grounded Theory introduces the necessity to explicitly account for the link between observations and their underlying generative mechanisms, and the use of retroduction in order to abstract these mechanisms (Oliver 2011).\nThe process of data acquisition is performed by a series of interviews and literature assessment. The interviews inquire possible causes of NVS and the social groups related to this phenomena. After each interview, the answers are coded into general terms, and with related questions of how and why they can affect NVS. These questions are transformed into literature database queries, that helps finding written material that may enrich analysis with convergences or divergences with interview answers, or with new possible causes of NVS. After each round of interviews and literature assessment, the next interview may change to accommodate findings from the previous. This cyclic process is demonstrated in Figure 2.2.\n\n\n\n\n\nflowchart TD\n    A[Interview] --&gt; B[Data]\n    C[Questions] --&gt; D[Literature Assessment]\n    D --&gt; E[Data]\n    B --&gt; F[Theoretical Model]\n    F --&gt; C\n    E --&gt; F\n    F --&gt; A\n\n\n\nFigure 2.2: Workflow of theoretical model development\n\n\n\n\nThis process is repeated until the data from interviews and literature assessment starts to get redundant, adding little additional information to the theoretical model.\n\n2.1.1 Experts Interviews\nThe objective of the interviews is to explore a diverse range of possible causes of NVS.\nThe target participants are researchers with past experience on analyzing NVS in the Amazon or Cerrado biomes.\nThe prospecting of potential participants is done by snowball sampling.\nThe interviews consist of open and closed questions, and an interactive activity of building a DAG with the participants. The objective of developing DAGs with different participants is to explore a diversity of possibilities to theorize NVS causes. The use of DAGs before any modeling exercise (such as variables selection) is useful to reflect about the phenomena. It is also possible to compare DAGs (since they are graphs), so it will open an opportunity to explore convergences and divergences between participants.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\n\n\nREAD:\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.11157/fohpe.v20i3.387\nhttps://doi.org/10.1177/1468794118781718\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/S0167-9236(03)00095-2\nhttps://doi.org/10.1080/13645579.2021.1935565\nhttps://doi.org/10.1080/13645579.2020.1766777\nhttps://doi.org/10.1080/13645579.2018.1503400\n\n\n\n\nThe questions aims to develop a context of the participant experience and perspectives on NVS.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  Table 2.1:  Interview schedule used in this project. \n  \n  \n    \n      Opening\n    \n    My name is Hugo Tameirão Seixas, I’m a doctorate student leading a research on modeling natural vegetation suppression in the Amazon and Cerrado.\nEstablish rapport\n    Thank you so much for agreeing to this interview.

However, it is performed as a complement to the reviews. The queries of the literature assessment are created based on reflections of the causal relationships identified in the interviews (e.g. if variable A is believed to cause B, what is the chain of events that allows this process?). Once the queries are created, a forward snowball search is performed, in which the resulting papers and its citing documents are screened.\n\n\n\n\n\nflowchart TD\n    A[Questions] --&gt; B[Query Development]\n    A[Questions] --&gt; C[Documents Screening]\n    B[Query Development] --&gt; D[Database Search]\n    D[Database Search] --&gt; C[Documents Screening]\n    C[Documents Screening] --&gt; E[Documents Collection]\n    E[Documents Collection] --&gt; F[Forward Snowball Search]\n    F[Forward Snowball Search] --&gt; C[Documents Screening]\n    E[Documents Collection] --&gt; G[Final Collection]\n\n\n\nFigure 2.3: Workflow of literature review\n\n\n\n\nThe relevant results from the literature are documented and stored for the creation of the theoretical model, in conjunction with the data acquired from the interviews.\n\n\n2.1.3 Variables description\nThe possible causes of NVS that are included in the theoretical model may or may not be observed as data, but all of them are described in this section. The variables may present diverse nature, such as quantitative and qualitative.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  Table 2.2:  Variables used in this project. \n  \n    \n    \n      Variable\n      Source\n      Creator\n      Format\n      License\n    \n  \n  \n    Biomes\nIPEA\nIBGE\nSpatial Vector\n—\n    Deforestation\nMapbiomas\nMapbiomas\nSpatial Matrix\n—\n    Natural Vegetation\nMapbiomas\nMapbiomas\nSpatial Matrix\n—\n    Antropic Cover\nMapbiomas\nMapbiomas\nSpatial Matrix\n—\n    Conservation Units\nIPEA\nMMAMC\nSpatial Vector\n—\n    Indigenous Lands\nFUNAI\nFUNAI\nSpatial Vector\n—\n    Roads\nDNIT\n—\nSpatial Vector\n—\n    Rural Property Limits\nMMAMC\n—\nSpatial Vector\n—\n    Population\nIBGE\n—\nTabular\n—\n    Public Policies\n—\n—\nText\n—\n    Agricultural Production\n—\n—\nTabular\n—\n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.1.3.1 Biomes\nThe biomes limits are provided by IBGE. The extent of the biomes have been changing over the years, and since we are working on a time series, the extent will dependent on the year. The biomes limits were defined by IBGE at 2004, and was updated in 2019.\nThe downloaded data was filtered to contain only the limits of the Amazon and Cerrado biomes.\n\n\n2.1.3.2 Natural Vegetation Suppression\nThe term of NVS is used to avoid the ambiguity of using the deforestation definition, recent research reviewed 65 reports, and found 15 definitions of deforestation, and 9 definitions of forests (Oca et al. 2021). There are also practical implications in how to identify NVS by satellite images, but in this project I simplify it by accounting for any non-trivial transition from natural vegetation to antropic land uses.\nThe NVS variable is derived from the MapBiomas land use and land cover collection (version 7.1).\nThe downloaded data was cropped to the extent of the Cerrado and Amazon biomes and projected to the SIRGAS 2000 / Brazil Policonic cartesian projection (EPSG:5880), which represents fixed area pixels in meters. Than the raster data was aggregated to a coarser spatial resolution, from 30 to 150 meters, assigning the value of the most frequent class to the new pixel (the mode of the 25 pixels that will be aggregated to the 150 meters pixels). This was done to reduce the amount of observations, which would be unfeasible to process, since the original data consists of hundreds of billions pixels.\nThe conversion from land use data to NVS is made for each grid cell. To perform this conversion, the downloaded raster files are cropped to the grid cell extent, and labeled in six groups: natural vegetation, pasture, temporary crops, perennial crops, forest plantation, and mosaic. The following step is to identify transitions between natural vegetation to antropic use, and calculate the area of those transitions for the grid cell. These transitions represents the NVS.\n\n\n2.1.3.3 Conservation Units\nThe limits of the Conservation Units (UC) are provided by the Ministry of Environment and Climate Change. These are the conservation units that finished the registration process at the National Register of Conservation Units (CNUC). However, the data used in this project is accessed by the Institute for Applied Economic Research (IPEA), which organizes data in a standard attributes and spatial projection. The data is represented as spatial vectors.\nThe UC vectors are intersected to the base grid, and the area of each UC inside each cell is calculated.\n\n\n2.1.3.4 Indigenous Lands\nThe limits of Indigenous Lands (IL) inside the Amazon and Cerrado are provided by FUNAI."

This field is where disputes over land happens. The concept of LUCF is broad, and may contain diverse types of disputes, however, in this work it is bounded to disputes related to NVS.\nThe social rules dictate the disputes inside the LUCF, and are not restrained only by the politics institutions and devices.\nSocial actors are conceptualized as groups of interest that represents not only individuals that share a common culture and goals, but also institutions.\nThe power of the social actors can manifest in different ways, such as economic, political, symbolic, social and cultural power.\nThe sociological analysis will consist in identifying the social actors and their power, for each cause of NVS (that were proposed in the theoretical model).

It is performed by structuring a database of observed variables that are considered to be a possible cause of the NVS, followed by a selection of variables according to the theoretical model, and finally the prediction of NVS.\n\n2.3.1 Database Structuring\nThe database contains data from different social and natural dimensions, which can be available in diverse formats and structures. To make the modeling process more efficient and transparent, all variables of interest must be organized coherently.\nThe process to create the database consists of accessing the data sources, downloading the data to the local environment, transforming and organizing the data to the grid, and store in the local environment.\n\n\n\n\n\nflowchart TD\n    A[Data Source] --&gt; E[Pre Processing]\n    B[Base Grid] --&gt; E[Pre Processing]\n    E[Pre Processing] --&gt; F[Gridded Data]\n    F[Gridded Data] --&gt; G[Database]\n\n\n\nFigure 2.4: Diagram of the process to create the project database.\n\n\n\n\nThe data are stored in a nested directories database with hive-style partitioning. The database is composed of a collection of parquet files, a format with high compression, that facilitates processing large volumes of data. The main partition stores the variables, which means that each variable will be stored in a separate directory. If necessary, the data will be partitioned by further variables (as a rule of thumb, each parquet file should not be smaller than 20MB and not bigger than 2GB).\nTo structure a collection of data that presents different natures, I must transform all the variables into a standard grid system. The grid system will be composed of 0.2 degrees cells (40km x 40km), which should be a balanced compromise between detail and computational cost.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.5: Model grid, in which variables were transformed to.\n\n\n\n\nEach grid cell contains one observation, for each year, for all the variables.\n\n\n2.3.2 Model Development\nThe statistical model follow the standard approach to develop supervised models.\nThe variables selection will be performed according to available data of possible causes of NVS (as stated in the theoretical model), the selection will also be performed to remove variables that can induce unwanted bias in the results, such as colliders and mediators.\nThe data splitting between training and training, validation and testing groups will be performed in order to avoid spatial and temporal correlation between observations.\nThe parameters adjustments will be performed by cross validation methods for resampling and racing techniques for parameter optimization. In this process, validation data will be used for parameter adjustments.\nAfter the final model fit, accuracy metrics will be calculated in order to estimate the error of the statistical model.

    "text": "3.1 Theoretical Model\nThe NVS Theoretical Model have the purpose to formally describe the phenomena manifestation process. Therefore, before presenting the model, it is necessary to revisit the concept of NVS being adopted.\nThe NVS, abbreviation for Natural Vegetation Suppression, is an action performed directly by humans, and consists of the transformation of an area occupied by natural vegetation. This transformation occurs by the removal of the natural vegetation to a degree in which the area is no longer recognized as a natural formation, by the human perception.\nTo describe the NVS Theoretical Model, I especulate about the causal mechanism that, when manifested, materializes the NVS.\nI propose four phenomena that composes the causal mechanism of NVS:\n\nValue: It is the possible values that can be attributed to a certain natural vegetation, occuping a certain space at a certain time;\nGains: The benefits that supressing a certain natural vegetation (in a certain space, at a certain time) may provide to the agent that is performing the action of supression;\nLosses: The drawbacks that may arise against the agent, as a concequence of its action of supression of a certain natural vegetation (in a certain space, at a certain time);\nWork: Is the physical manifestation of a social agent performing the action of natural vegetation suppression;\n\nThe causal mechanism is the relationship between the value of a natural vegetation, and the gain and losses of its suppression, followed the possibility of work. The NVS will be manifested when the causal mechanism is triggered, therefore, when there is a favorable opportunity, and there is the possibility of execution.\nAccording to the ontological paradigm being adopted, this causal mechanism lies in the domain of the real. I assume that it is absolute, in the sense that it do not change over time and space, and that the analysed phenomena (the NVS) is manifested only when this causal mechanism is triggered.\nThe causal mechanism is trigerred when a social agent and the natural vegetation exists in the same space and time, and when the dillema of the supression arises. The context of the situation in which the causal mechanism is triggrered will define the characteristics of value, gains, losses and work. This means that while the causal mechanism do not change over time and space, it will be manifested as different forms, depending of the context. The idea developed in this paragraph depicts the actual domain of the adopted ontology paradigm.\nThe form in which the NVS causal mechanism will manifest changes according to the situation context. The value of a natural vegetation, the gains and losses from its supression, and the work demanded for its execution are never the same, they are situational. The value of a natural vegetation can be easily represented by cultural aspects of social agents, while gains and losses can be represented as material and social capital, and work can be related to technology and momentum.\nHowever, how these aspects of the NVS causal mechanisms are perceived and interpreted by the social agents when it is trigerred is always partial. The social agent does not have access, or it is insensible, to certain values of the natural vegetation. The social agent has also a partial perception of gains and losses, it does not know all consequences of their action. At last, the work that executed the suppression is not always percepted, as it can be unintentional."

The distribution of NVS for the Cerrado is less skewed, and show more frequent values close to 1000 ha a year Figure 3.3.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.3: Distribution of natural vegetation suppression in the Amazon and Cerrado. The horizontal scale is transformed to base 10 log.\n\n\n\n\nThe cumulative NVS area shows that grid cells with high values of NVS accounts for the majority of the total NVS in a year, for the Amazon NVS from 3000ha to 18000 ha, which are the 25% highest values, accounts for 79% of all NVS Figure 3.4. For the Cerrado, NVS from 900 ha to 12000 ha, the 25% highest values, accounts for 57% of the total NVS Figure 3.4.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.4: Cumulative percent of the natural vegetation suppression area.\n\n\n\n\nThe spatial distribution of NVS shows a concentration in some regions of the Amazon, specially in areas in proximity to the Cerrado biome Figure 3.5. However, the distribution of NVS in the Cerrado shows a different pattern, where the NVS occurrence is spread in the whole biome Figure 3.5.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.5: Spatial distribution of the natural vegetation suppression area.\n\n\n\n\nThe NVS time series shows periods of increase of NVS in the Amazon from 1985 to 2003, followed by a consistent drop of NVS area after 2003 Figure 3.6. For the Cerrado, the NVS area have been decreasing since the start of the time series, with some periods of increase in 2004 and 2013.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.6: Time series of natural vegetation suppression area.\n\n\n\n\nThe natural vegetation types that suffered suppression are Forests, Grasslands, Savannas and Wetlands.

The creation of protected areas in Brazil dates from 1896, with the creation of the first National Park in São Paulo (Drummond, Andrade Franco, and Ninis 2009), however, it was only in 2000 that a law was approved to create a system to organize and regulate the UCs, named as the National System of Conservation Units (SNUC) (Drummond, Andrade Franco, and Ninis 2009; Borges, Rezende, and Pereira 2009; Moreira et al. 2021). The SNUC comprises federal, state and municipal UCs of different characteristics (Borges, Rezende, and Pereira 2009).\nIn the grid of analysis, the maximum area occupied by UC in a single cell is 78000 ha, which is the total cell area Figure 3.9. The majority of cells do not present any area of UC Figure 3.9.\n\n\nWarning: `includeHTML()` was provided a `path` that appears to be a complete HTML document.\n✖ Path: ./figs/eda/uc_table.html\nℹ Use `tags$iframe()` to include an HTML document.

    "section": "A.1 Critical Realism",
    "text": "A.1 Critical Realism\nCritical realism is a philosophy of science that may serve as a framework for developing research methodologies (Fletcher 2016). It is a perspective that negates the duality between the social and the natural, as also negates the determination of the social by the natural (Gorski 2013), and neither the other way around (Fletcher 2016). Instead, its focus is on the inference of causal mechanisms (Lawani 2020), which dictates the natural and the social altogether. In this section, I define the ontology and epistemology, based on the paradigm of critical realism, adopted in this work, and how they justify the methodology.\n\nOntology: There are three ontological domains, in other words, reality is stratified: the domain of the real, formed by the generative mechanisms that act as causal forces to produce events (Fletcher 2016); the domain of the actual, that contains the realization of the real domain, when the generative mechanisms are activated and occurs whether or not these realizations can be perceived or measured; the domain of the empirical where the actual domain is observed, in other words, is where the events caused by the activation of generative mechanisms of the real domain are perceived or measured;\nEpistemology: Knowldge is obtained by interpreting patterns and tendencies of perceived and measured events, with the objective of explaining the phenomena of interest by the generative mechanisms that dictates it (Lawani 2020; Wynn and Williams 2012).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\n\n\nREAD:\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1007/s11191-018-9983-x\n\n\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-019-7760-7\nhttps://doi.org/10.1177/15586898211049847\nhttps://doi.org/10.1558/aleth.v5i1.56\nhttps://doi.org/10.1177/1368431015590700\nhttps://doi.org/10.1111/1468-5914.00127\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.cpa.2016.03.001\nhttps://doi.org/10.1111/1467-954X.00407\nhttps://doi.org/10.1558/jcr.v3i1.133\nhttps://doi.org/10.1111/0735-2751.00064\nhttps://doi.org/10.1177/0018726718767952"

    "text": "A.2 Sociological Field Theory\nThe field theory is a method of analysis that describes social arenas where actors pursue an objective at stake, interacting with other actors to achieve their goals (Kluttz and Fligstein 2016). Bourdieu is a recognized sociologist that influenced the Sociological Field Theory, having developed the concepts of field, habitus, capital and doxa. His theory is widely applied in diverse areas of study due to its generalized nature.\nThe concept of field in the perspective of Bourdieu is that fields are arenas of disputes between different social actors (Kluttz and Fligstein 2016). The social actors occupy a certain position in the field, and are in dispute towards an objective at stake (Thomson 2014). Each field functions according to it’s own logic, or in other words, present specific “rules of the game” (Kluttz and Fligstein 2016; Thomson 2014).\nThe capital is the manifestation of different types of power, that can be economic, cultural or social (Kluttz and Fligstein 2016).\nThe habitus is a property of social actors, that along with the capital and the field, shapes the practices of these social actors (Maton 2014). It describes a dynamic process of action performed in the field, formed by subjective constructions and objective dispositions, in a sense that the habitus of these social actors is affected by and also affects the social structures of a field (Kluttz and Fligstein 2016).\nThe doxa can be considered as implicit rules operating within a field. It the result of conquests of social actors that set rules, laws, discursive forms, normative beliefs, expected actions and behaviors and barriers to entry in a specific field (Deer 2014).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\n\n\nREAD:\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.cpa.2016.03.001\nhttps://doi.org/10.1111/1468-5914.00127\nhttps://doi.org/10.1177/0018726718767952"

    "section": "A.3 Statistical Modeling",
    "text": "A.3 Statistical Modeling\nStatistical modeling can be useful for explaining and predicting an observable phenomena. When creating a statistical model, we accept (implicitly or explicitly) a diverse number of assumptions that should be true for the model to represent reality correctly. However, the correctness of all the assumptions is impossible, so we are limited to make estimations about the phenomena of interest. Following this reasoning, we should not condition the reality to the statistical models that we create, in reality, it should be the other way around, theories about reality should condition our statistical models.\nThe use of statistical causal inference methods is a possible way to develop a statistical model informed by causal theory, and is usually applied when the objective is to explain certain phenomena. Statistical algorithms can also be used solely for prediction, with the goal of minimizing prediction errors, but not taking to account causal mechanisms of the phenomena of interest. However, both approaches do not need to be completely separated, prediction exercises can also be informed by causal inference techniques, in order to create fair statistical models, which can be useful for exploration of a phenomena.\nThe statistical perspective is coherent with the ontological perspective of Critical Realism. Statistical inference aims to propose models of data generating process, which are the causal mechanisms that forms the real domain. In statistics we are only able to perform these inferences based on observable events triggered by the activation of certain causal mechanisms, and our estimations of that event is an imperfect representation of the actual domain. The “distance” between the empirical and the actual domains is defined as the error of a statistical model, and integrates estimates and model errors."
