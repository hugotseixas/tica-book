    "section": "",
    "text": "Preface\nThis work is an effort to develop an interdisciplinary approach to analyze social and environmental dimensions related to Natural Vegetation Supression (NVS)1 in the Amazon and Cerrado biomes. The main objective is to use qualitative and quantitative methods to explore causes of NVS in these areas, and uncover underlying social conflicts that emerge and shape this phenomena.1 I’m considering any type of natural vegetation suppression caused by human activity, including forest formations, shrublands and grasslands. This is also usually named as deforestation.\nThe motivation to develop this research is to account for a diversity of factors involved in the NVS process. When analyzing social and environmental variables, we must always remember what lies hidden in numerical values, individuals, relationships, culture, landscapes. Is it possible to avoid omitting these when conducting research at large scales? How to represent them inside structured data formats?\nThe fact is that is usually not possible to abstract certain processes in a quantitative framework. That’s why interdisciplinary approaches, using qualitative and quantitative methods, can support deep and rich analysis about complex and dynamic processes, such as NVS.\nIn this work, I try to perform such task by running parallel analysis of different dimensions, but based in common grounds. Such as Figure 1 and Figure 2, this project is composed by numerical analysis of structured spatial data (represented as regular grid cells), as also by sociological investigation of social and environmental processes that can’t be measured.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Representation of the Amazon biome. TODO Describe some of the images inside the cells.\n\n\n\n\nBefore diving into this work, I would like to first introduce some key foundations adopted in my research (see more at Appendix A).\nAs a philosophical background for the work, I have adopted the perspective of Critical Realism (see Section A.1), which focuses the reflection about causal mechanisms. This is the research paradigm for the thesis, and the perspective I use both in planning the analysis and interpreting my results.\nThe information gathering to create my scientific model2 is based on Grounded Theory”, which is a general method to gather data in qualitative studies and test theories. I have adapted this method to gather data from interviews and the literature, in order to trace the causes of deforestation.2 The scientific model is the abstraction of the generative process that rules the observed phenomena. The scientific model defines the variables and their mutual relationships.\nThe qualitative assessment of the resulting scientific model is based on the Sociological Field Theory in the perspective of Bordieu’s work (see Section A.2). The concepts of social fields and habitus of different social actors is a powerful tool to explore underlying mechanisms related to NVS in Brazil.\nFor the quantitative analysis (see Section A.3), a subset of variables from the scientific model were selected by two criteria: (1) the variable can be represented in a structured numerical format; (2) the variable is assumed to have a causal effect on NVS. The second criterion relies on formal causal inference methods of variable selection, which is fundamental to create fair and robust statistical learning models. Apart from using causality foundations to select variables, the quantitative analysis is based on a prediction modeling framework, composed by statistical learning algorithms.\nFinally, the results from qualitative and quantitative assessments are compared and discussed in light with the literature. Interpretation and discussion of results relies on a skeptical perspective of the models, which are a flawed representation of the phenomena of interest. However, they still provide a useful source of information to advance the knowledge about the NVS in the Amazon and Cerrado.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Representation of the Cerrado biome. TODO Describe some of the images inside the cells.\n\n\n\n\nThis is a work of exploratory nature, and avoids diagnostic prescription to solve the NVS problem. Instead, it presents a different framework to assess the phenomena, which relies on multiple areas of knowledge. The document is likely to engage specially with readers with interest on NVS, but it also provides rich material to the subjects of Critical Realism, Sociological Field Theory, Grounded Theory, Causal Inference and Machine Learning."

To make the modeling process more efficient and transparent, all variables of interest must be organized coherently.\nThe process to create the database will consist of accessing the data sources, downloading the data to the local environment, transforming and organizing the data to the grid (if the data source provides any pre-processing tool before downloading the data, it should be done that way), and store in the local environment.\n\n\n\n\n\nflowchart TD\n    A[Data Source] --&gt; E[Pre Processing]\n    B[Base Grid] --&gt; E[Pre Processing]\n    E[Pre Processing] --&gt; F[Gridded Data]\n    F[Gridded Data] --&gt; G[Database]\n\n\n\nFigure 2.3: Mermaid diagram\n\n\n\n\nThe data will be stored in a nested directories database with hive-style partitioning.

The main partition will be the variables, which means that each variable will be stored in a separate directory. If necessary, the data will be partitioned by further variables (as a rule of thumb, each parquet file should not be smaller than 20MB and not bigger than 2GB).\n\n2.3.1 Base grid\nTo structure a collection of data that presents different natures, I will transform all the variables into a standard grid system.

Than the raster data was aggregated to a coarser spatial resolution, from 30 to 300 meters, assigning the value of the most frequent class to the new pixel (the mode of the 100 pixels that will be aggregated to the 300 meters pixels). This was done to reduce the amount of observations, which would be unfeasible to process, since the original data consists of hundreds of billions pixels.\n\n\n2.3.2.3 Conservation Units\nThe limits of the Conservation Units (UC) are provided by the Ministry of Environment and Climate Change. These are the conservation units that finished the registration process at the National Register of Conservation Units (CNUC). However, the data used in this project is accessed by the Institute for Applied Economic Research (IPEA), which organizes data in a standard attributes and spatial projection. The data is represented as spatial vectors.\nThe UC vectors are intersected to the base grid, and the area of each UC inside each cell is calculated.\n\n\n2.3.2.4 Indigenous Lands\nThe limits of Indigenous Lands (IL) inside the Amazon and Cerrado are provided by FUNAI."

To achieve this, the model will be adjusted to present the minimum inclusion error for class “1”, and the probability threshold to classify an observation as class “1” will be a higher value.\nThe second model will predict the amount of vegetation suppression that was classified with the label “1” in the previous model. The predictions will have to be bounded by the amount of natural vegetation inside the grid cell (a Poisson distribution may be adequate to represent this variable).\nThe third model will predict the predominant land use transitions of the areas that suffered native vegetation suppression.\nThe fourth model will be a set of models.

These methods are model-agnostic, meaning they can be applied to any regression or classification model, regardless of its underlying structure or parameters. By using these techniques, I aim to gain a deeper understanding of the relationships between the variables and how they contribute to the predictions. This information will enable assessing the reliability of the models and validity of their results."

Specifically, I will be examining how the results can be used to inform and support decision making, particularly when dealing with complex environmental and human well-being issues that involve multiple dimensions. In many cases, decision making related to vegetation removals and their impact on the environment and human well-being can be challenging due to the multiple and sometimes conflicting factors that need to be considered.\nThe findings can be used to identify the most significant factors that contribute to vegetation removals and their impact on the environment and human well-being, as well as how these factors interact with one another.

Finally, we will predict the impact of these findings on the environment and human well-being.\nAs part of the study, I will not only present the predictions generated by the models but also perform an in-depth analysis of the model’s behavior.

The method of Grounded Theory is widely used in social sciences with the objective of generating theories, it consists of an interactive and concurrent process of data collection and analysis. It have been modified trough time to accommodate different paradigms of research, such as the Critical Realism.\nThe Critical Realist Grounded Theory introduces the necessity to explicitly account for the link between observations and their underlying generative mechanisms, and the use of retroduction in order to abstract these mechanisms (Oliver 2011).\nThe process of data acquisition is performed by a series of interviews and literature assessment. The interviews inquire possible causes of NVS and the social groups related to this phenomena. After each interview, the answers are coded into general terms, and with related question of how and why they can affect NVS. These questions are transformed into literature database queries, that helps finding written material that may enrich analysis with convergences or divergences with interview answers, or with new causes of NVS. After each round of interviews and literature assessment, the next interview may change to accommodate findings from the previous.

However, it is performed as a complement to the reviews. The queries of the literature assessment are created based on reflections of the causal relationships identified in the interviews (e.g. if variable A is believed to cause B, what is the chain of events that allows this process?). Once the queries are created, a forward snowball search is performed, in which the resulting papers and its citing documents are screened.\n\n\n\n\n\nflowchart TD\n    A[Questions] --&gt; B[Query Development]\n    A[Questions] --&gt; C[Documents Screening]\n    B[Query Development] --&gt; D[Database Search]\n    D[Database Search] --&gt; C[Documents Screening]\n    C[Documents Screening] --&gt; E[Documents Collection]\n    E[Documents Collection] --&gt; F[Forward Snowball Search]\n    F[Forward Snowball Search] --&gt; C[Documents Screening]\n    E[Documents Collection] --&gt; G[Final Collection]\n\n\n\nFigure 2.3: Workflow of literature review\n\n\n\n\nThe relevant results from the literature are documented and stored for the creation of the theoretical model, in conjunction with the data acquired from the interviews.\n\n\n2.1.3 Variables description\nThe variables used in this project will serve to predict deforestation and its impacts on social and environmental dimensions.

Than the raster data was aggregated to a coarser spatial resolution, from 30 to 300 meters, assigning the value of the most frequent class to the new pixel (the mode of the 100 pixels that will be aggregated to the 300 meters pixels). This was done to reduce the amount of observations, which would be unfeasible to process, since the original data consists of hundreds of billions pixels.\n\n\n2.1.3.3 Conservation Units\nThe limits of the Conservation Units (UC) are provided by the Ministry of Environment and Climate Change. These are the conservation units that finished the registration process at the National Register of Conservation Units (CNUC).

The analysis consists on defining a social field, its social rules, social actors within the field, and the power relationships between the actors.\nIn this project, the social field is idealized as an arena where NVS is materialized, in which I name as Land Use and Cover Field (LUCF). This field is where disputes over land happens. The concept of LUCF is broad, and may contain diverse types of disputes, however, in this work it is bounded to disputes related to NVS.\nThe social rules dictate the disputes inside the LUCF, and are not restrained only by the politics institutions and devices.\nSocial actors are conceptualized as groups of interest that represents not only individuals that share a common culture and goals, but also institutions.\nThe power of the social actors can manifest in different ways, such as economic, political, symbolic, social and cultural power.\nThe sociological analysis will consist in identifying the social groups and their power in each of the causes of NVS (that were proposed in the theoretical model). The relationship between these social groups will also be characterized.

It is performed by structuring a database of observed variables that are considered to be a possible cause of the NVS, followed by a selection of variables according to the theoretical model, and finally the prediction of NVS.\n\n2.3.1 Database Structuring\nThe database contains data from different social and natural dimensions, which can be available in diverse formats and structures. To make the modeling process more efficient and transparent, all variables of interest must be organized coherently.\nThe process to create the database consists of accessing the data sources, downloading the data to the local environment, transforming and organizing the data to the grid, and store in the local environment.\n\n\n\n\n\nflowchart TD\n    A[Data Source] --&gt; E[Pre Processing]\n    B[Base Grid] --&gt; E[Pre Processing]\n    E[Pre Processing] --&gt; F[Gridded Data]\n    F[Gridded Data] --&gt; G[Database]\n\n\n\nFigure 2.4: Mermaid diagram\n\n\n\n\nThe data are stored in a nested directories database with hive-style partitioning. The database is composed of a collection of parquet files, a format with high compression, that facilitates processing large volumes of data. The main partition stores the variables, which means that each variable will be stored in a separate directory. If necessary, the data will be partitioned by further variables (as a rule of thumb, each parquet file should not be smaller than 20MB and not bigger than 2GB).\nTo structure a collection of data that presents different natures, I must transform all the variables into a standard grid system. The grid system will be composed of 0.2 degrees cells (40km x 40km), which should be a balanced compromise between detail and computational cost.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.5: Model grid, in which variables were transformed to\n\n\n\n\nEach grid cell contains one observation, for each year, for all the variables.

In this process, validation data will be used for parameter adjustments.\nAfter the final model fit, accuracy metrics will be calculated in order to estimate the error of the statistical model.

It is a perspective that negates the duality between the social and the natural, as also negates the determination of the social by the natural (Gorski 2013), and neither the other way around (Fletcher 2016). Instead, its focus is on the inference of causal mechanisms (Lawani 2020), which dictates the natural and the social altogether. In this section, I define the ontology and epistemology, based on the paradigm of critical realism, adopted in this work, and how they justify the methodology.\n\nOntology: There are three ontological domains, in other words, reality is stratified: the domain of the real, formed by the generative mechanisms that act as causal forces to produce events (Fletcher 2016); the domain of the actual, that contains the realization of the real domain, when the generative mechanisms are activated and occurs whether or not these realizations can be perceived or measured; the domain of the empirical where the actual domain is observed, in other words, is where the events caused by the activation of generative mechanisms of the real domain are perceived or measured;\nEpistemology: Knowldge is obtained by interpreting patterns and tendencies of perceived and measured events, with the objective of explaining the phenomena of interest by the generative mechanisms that dictates it (Lawani 2020; Wynn and Williams 2012).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\n\n\nREAD:\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1007/s11191-018-9983-x\n\n\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-019-7760-7\nhttps://doi.org/10.1177/15586898211049847\nhttps://doi.org/10.1558/aleth.v5i1.56\nhttps://doi.org/10.1177/1368431015590700\nhttps://doi.org/10.1111/1468-5914.00127\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.cpa.2016.03.001\nhttps://doi.org/10.1111/1467-954X.00407\nhttps://doi.org/10.1558/jcr.v3i1.133\nhttps://doi.org/10.1111/0735-2751.00064\nhttps://doi.org/10.1177/0018726718767952"

Bourdieu is a recognized sociologist that influenced the Sociological Field Theory, having developed the concepts of field, habitus, capital and doxa. His theory is widely applied in diverse areas of study due to its generalized nature.\nThe concept of field in the perspective of Bourdieu is that fields are arenas of disputes between different social actors (Kluttz and Fligstein 2016). The social actors occupy a certain position in the field, and are in dispute towards an objective at stake (Thomson 2014).

    "text": "A.1 Critical Realism\nCritical realism is a philosophy of science that may serve as a framework for developing research methodologies (Fletcher 2016). It is a perspective that negates the duality between the social and the natural, as also negates the determination of the social by the natural (Gorski 2013), and neither the other way around (Fletcher 2016). Instead, its focus is on the inference of causal mechanisms (Lawani 2020), which dictates the natural and the social altogether. In this section, I define the ontology and epistemology, based on the paradigm of critical realism, adopted in this work, and how they justify the methodology.\n\nOntology: There are three ontological domains, in other words, reality is stratified: the domain of the real, formed by the generative mechanisms that act as causal forces to produce events (Fletcher 2016); the domain of the actual, that contains the realization of the real domain, when the generative mechanisms are activated and occurs whether or not these realizations can be perceived or measured; the domain of the empirical where the actual domain is observed, in other words, is where the events caused by the activation of generative mechanisms of the real domain are perceived or measured;\nEpistemology: Knowldge is obtained by interpreting patterns and tendencies of perceived and measured events, with the objective of explaining the phenomena of interest by the generative mechanisms that dictates it (Lawani 2020; Wynn and Williams 2012).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\n\n\nREAD:\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1007/s11191-018-9983-x\n\n\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-019-7760-7\nhttps://doi.org/10.1177/15586898211049847\nhttps://doi.org/10.1558/aleth.v5i1.56\nhttps://doi.org/10.1177/1368431015590700\nhttps://doi.org/10.1111/1468-5914.00127\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.cpa.2016.03.001\nhttps://doi.org/10.1111/1467-954X.00407\nhttps://doi.org/10.1558/jcr.v3i1.133\nhttps://doi.org/10.1111/0735-2751.00064\nhttps://doi.org/10.1177/0018726718767952"

    "text": "A.2 Sociological Field Theory\nThe field theory is a method of analysis that describes social arenas where actors pursue an objective at stake, interacting with other actors to achieve their goals (Kluttz and Fligstein 2016). Bourdieu is a recognized sociologist that influenced the Sociological Field Theory, having developed the concepts of field, habitus, capital and doxa. His theory is widely applied in diverse areas of study due to its generalized nature.\nThe concept of field in the perspective of Bourdieu is that fields are arenas of disputes between different social actors (Kluttz and Fligstein 2016). The social actors occupy a certain position in the field, and are in dispute towards an objective at stake (Thomson 2014). Each field functions according to it’s own logic, or in other words, present specific “rules of the game” (Kluttz and Fligstein 2016; Thomson 2014).\nThe capital is the manifestation of different types of power, that can be economic, cultural or social (Kluttz and Fligstein 2016).\nThe habitus is a property of social actors, that along with the capital and the field, shapes the practices of these social actors (Maton 2014).
