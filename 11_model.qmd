# Model

The modelling methodology should be appropriate to deal with spatiotemporal dynamics.

There will be two exercises: create a model to optimize prediction of deforestation; create a model to estimate causal effect of a treatment.

The first algorithm on the list of possibilities is the Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (BART).
