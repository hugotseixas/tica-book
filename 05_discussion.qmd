# Discussion

In this study, I will be comparing the outcomes of my models, which are grounded in regression and classification predictive modeling, to the conclusions drawn from previous research that primarily utilized statistical inference and mechanistic models.
My aim is to analyze the potential advantages and limitations of the methodology I have developed through this comparison.

In addition to comparing the results of my models with previous research, I will also be exploring the practical implications of the findings.
Specifically, I will be examining how the results can be used to inform and support decision making, particularly when dealing with complex environmental and human well-being issues that involve multiple dimensions. 
In many cases, decision making related to vegetation removals and their impact on the environment and human well-being can be challenging due to the multiple and sometimes conflicting factors that need to be considered.

The findings can be used to identify the most significant factors that contribute to vegetation removals and their impact on the environment and human well-being, as well as how these factors interact with one another. 
This information can then be used to prioritize the most pressing issues and to design targeted interventions and strategies to mitigate the negative effects of vegetation removals.
